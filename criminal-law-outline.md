Majority approach: Accomplice liability does not depend on the principal being found guilty - they can even be found not guilty

# Attempt

An attempt requires

i) a substantial step toward the commission of the crime

Factual impossibility is not a defense.

Irresistable Impulse: Lacked capacity for self control

Durham Rule: Unlawful act product of mental defect
