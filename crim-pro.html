        <h1>Crim Pro</h1>
<h1>Exiegent circumstances</h1>
<p>OK to search/arrest without a warrant. Examples: destruction of evidence, save a life. Not examples: we just saw the dude we wanna arrest.</p>
<h1>Mistrial</h1>
<p>When a mistrial is declared despite the defendant&rsquo;s opposition, the defendant cannot be retried unless the mistrial is due to a manifest necessity. A hung jury constitutes a manifest necessity.</p>
<h1>Search Warrants</h1>
<p>A valid search warrant must be issued by a neutral and detached magistrate based ob probable cause supported by oath or affadavit. A tip from an unknown informant is not valid.</p>
<p>Officers can search a vehicle with only probable cause.</p>
<p>Having a drug detection dag sniff the curtilage of a house constitutes a search and requires a warrant.</p>
<h2>Automobile exception</h2>
<p>Where a police officer makes a valid arrest of a passenger in a vehicle, the officer may search the interior of the vehicle. Police may only search a vehicle incident to the arrest of an occupant if i) the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search and as a result may pose an actual and continuing threat to the officer&rsquo;s safery or a need to preserve evidence from being tampered with by the arrestee or ii) it is reasonable to beleive the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of the arrest.</p>
<h1>Fifth Amendment</h1>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t apply to corporate records even if would implicate custodian of records</p>
<p>Does apply to subpoena if responding to subpoena would mean turning over incriminating evidence. But it doesn&rsquo;y apply to civil liability.</p>
<h2>Miranda Warnings</h2>
<p>Miranda warnings should be given after any break in the interrogation - arguably only a few hours even if they&rsquo;re in the interrogation room the whole time.</p>
<p>Invoking a right to counsel means being super unambiguous - saying &ldquo;this seems like the kind of thing where you should have a lawyer but I don&rsquo;t even know a good one&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>If someone is silent but does not assert their right to remain silent after miranda, this cannot be used to impeach them. If they are silent before Miranda this can be used to impeach them.</p>
<h2>Exceptions to Miranda</h2>
<p>If a confession is pre-Miranda but it is voluntary and un-coerced, even if the defendant is in custody, physical evidence recovered as a result of the un-Mirandized statement is admissible even if the statement itself is not.</p>
<h1>Separate counsel</h1>
<p>If an attorney representing co-defendants makes a timely motion for appointment of separate counsel based on a potential conflict of interest, the trial judge must either grant the motion or conduct a hearing. Failure to do so results in automatic reversal of a conviction.</p>
<h1>Sixth Amendment</h1>
<p>The right applies at all critical stages of a prosecution after formal proceedings have been initiated. Whether that&rsquo;s a post-arrest iniital appearance, formal charge, preliminary hearing, arraignment, etc.</p>
<p>The sixth amendment is offense specific - so even if there&rsquo;s another crime in the same criminal transaction and the defendant is already represented for purposes of the first crime, they won&rsquo;t count as having counsel and can be interrogated after Miranda for the second.</p>
<h1>Juries</h1>
<p>Racial exclusion under the equal protection clause is bad and requires a race-neutral explanation - even for grand juries.</p>
<h1>Death Penalty</h1>
<p>The trier of fact must convict the defendant of murder and find at least one aggravating circumstance at the guilt or penalty phase. The aggravating circumstance must not apply to every defendant convicted of murder and it cannot be unconstitutionally vauge (e.g. especially cruel/especiall heinous or brutal)</p>
<p>While the death penalty may be imposed for felony murder, it can&rsquo;t be imposed for accomplice liability. The defendant must participate in the commission of the felony and act with reckless indifference to human life. The person must kill, attempt to kill, or intend to kill the victim.</p>
<h1>Lineups and other identification</h1>
<p>No right to counsel for photo arrays.</p>
<p>Once the sixth amendment kickes in (once formal proceedings have begun) then defendants are entitled to counsel for in-person identification. This attaches with indictment or other formal proceedings NOT with arrest or miranda or even the demand for a lawyer.</p>
<h1>Double jeopardy</h1>
<p>If a mistrial is declared because of a hung jury, the defendant may be retried</p>
<h1>Prosecutors</h1>
<p>In Michigan: The prosecuting atty shall attach to filed info a list of all witnesses known to prosecuting atty who might be called at trial and all res gestae witnesses known to prosecutor or investigating officers. At least 30 days before trial, prosecutor has to submit their final list. </p>
<h1>Michigan: Degree Hearing</h1>
<p>When someone has pleaded guilty and there is a hearing merely to establish the degree of their crime, the questioning is simply an extension of the guilty plea and there is no Fifth amendment privilege.</p>
<h1>Michigan: Double Jeopardy</h1>
<p>The Michigan Constitution protects a person against being placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense. This prohibition protects against three specific types of jeopardy. First, one may not be prosecuted a second time for the same offense after an acquittal. Second, one may not be prosecuted a second time for the same offense. Third, one may not be punished more than once for the same offense.</p>
<p>The Blockburger test is whether the two charges require proof of the same elements. </p>
<h1>Michigan: Judge bias and pleading</h1>
<p>Judicial involvement in the bargaining of a sentence should be limited. A limit on judicial intervention is necessary to minimize the potential coercive effect on the defendant, to retain the function of the judge as a neutral arbiter, and to preserve the public perception of the judge as an impartial dispenser of justice. However, judicial involvement in pre-conviction negotiation of a sentence is not precluded as a matter of law. This is because the legislature has vested sentencing authority and discretion within the court and the court may not abdicate this function by allowing sentence agreements to control the sentencing process. </p>
<p>At the request of a party, and not on the judge&rsquo;s own initiative, a judge may state on the record the length of sentence that, on the basis of the informaiton then available to the judge, appears to be appropriate for the charged offense. The coercive position of the court is minimized where the court is not initiating the sentencing discussion but is merely responding to an inquiry regarding sentencing. Further, the court must take care to avoid express or implied alternative sentencing possibilities, such as sentencing variations that may arise from the exercise of the right to trial by jury. This is also necessary to avoid the potential of coercion. The judge&rsquo;s neutral and impartial role is enhanced when a judge provides a clear statement of information that is helpful to the parties.</p>
<p>When a defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendre to a charge, there is no infringement of the prosecutor&rsquo;s charging authority. It does not limit the prosecutor&rsquo;s right to introduce additional facts at appropriate points during the remaining pendancy of the case (like during sentencing). The prosecutor has wide latitude in the discretion to charge, but once a decision to charge is made, the prosecutor has no right to dictate the sentence. That right and duty vests exclusively with the court and the prosecutor&rsquo;s role in sentencing is limited to informing the court. </p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s preliminary evaluation of the case does not bin d the judge&rsquo;s sentencing discretion. When the sentencing court expresses the inability to follow the preliminary sentence evaluation, a defendant who relied upon such evaluation to enter a plea of guilty has the absolute right to withdraw the plea. To the extent a defendant wishes to withdraw a plea so offered and proceed to trial, the judge who has expressed opinions relating to sentencing remains subject to the disqualification rules under MCR 2.003. A decision not to sentence a defendant consistent with a preliminary sentencing evaluation is not a per se basis for recusal. A judge&rsquo;s candid statement of how a case appears at an early stage of the proceedings does not prevent the judge from deciding the vase in a fair and evenhanded manner later, when additional facts become known.</p>
<p>After hearing a sentence someone who made a plea deal can withdraw their plea.</p>
<p>Motions to disqualify a judge because of bias are sibject to de novo review by the chief judge of the circuit of a judge assigned by the State COurt Administrator&rsquo;s Office. </p>
