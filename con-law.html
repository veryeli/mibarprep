                A constitutional challenge of an ordinance or an enactment
based on vagueness is brought under the Due Process Clause of the
14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num002>2</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An ordinance or enactment is “void for vagueness” if what it
prohibits is “not clearly defined.”
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 An
ordinance must define the offense “with sufficient definiteness
that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and
in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement.”
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num004>4</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A person of ordinary intelligence should have a
“reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited” so he or she
may act accordingly. 
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are generally three ways an enactment (ordinance) can
be void for vagueness using the same criteria used to construe
statutes. These
are:
1. It does not provide fair notice of the conduct
proscribed.
2. It confers on the trier of fact unstructured and
unlimited discretion to determine whether an offense
has been committed.
3. Its coverage is overbroad and impinges on First
Amendment freedoms.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num004>4</a>
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is the additional danger that a person may steer far
wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden
areas were clearly marked.
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A challenge for vagueness not on First Amendment grounds is
“examined in light of the facts of each particular case.”
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A ordinance can be void for vaugeness if it
    1. It does not provide sufficient notice as to what
conduct is required or prohibited; or
2. It allows arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
by the code enforcement officer.
