    <title>Con Law</title>
</head>

        <h1>Con Law</h1>
<h1>Ballots and Voting</h1>
<p>There must be reasonable ways to get on the ballot, but prohibiting write-ins is ok. No inviduous discrimination to ballot access. Generally restricting access effectively to only two major parties not ok, but if e.g. socialists get &lt;1% of vote prohibiting them is ok.</p>
<p>A state may create a primary system as they see fit but it is subject to 1A regulation and it may not interfere with a political party&rsquo;s endorsement</p>
<h1>Citizenship</h1>
<p>Congress may not take away a person&rsquo;s citizenship obtained in good faith and without fraud.</p>
<h1>Congress</h1>
<h2>Commerce Clause</h2>
<p>Congress&rsquo;s ability to regulate instrastate activity that is not obviously economic is limited by principles of federalism when the regulation involves an area of traditional state concern.</p>
<p>States may tax interstate commerce if congress has not already acted in the particular area and if the tax does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce. The Supreme Court applies a four-part test to determine whether a state tax comports with the Commerce Clause: 1) there must be a substantial nexus between the activity taxed and the taxing state, 2) the tax must be fairly apportioned according to a rational formula, 3) the tax may not provide a direct commercial advantage to local businesses over interstate competitors, and 4) there must be a fair relationship between the tax and the service provided.</p>
<h2>Wartime powers</h2>
<p>The authority granted to Congress under the War Power of Article I, Section 8 is very broad. Congress may take whatever action it deems necessary to provide for the national defense in both wartime and peacetime including rent control of the civilian economy during wartime, and even during the post-war period. Rational basis analysis does not apply.</p>
<h2>Immunity</h2>
<p>State legislators are immune from liability for actions within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity. Comments made during e.g. committee meetings are within this sphere but those made to reporters are not.</p>
<h1>Contracts Clause</h1>
<p>The contracts clause of article I, Section 10 prohibits state legislation from retroactively impairing the obligation of contracts. It does not apply to federal action or court decisions</p>
<h1>Delegation</h1>
<p>Intelligible principles - Almosy any guidance to the delegate is consindered sufficient and there is almost no practical limitation to Congerss&rsquo; ability to delegate.</p>
<h1>Due Process</h1>
<p>For a person&rsquo;s procedural due process rights to be violated, the violation must be the result of an action undertaken by the government, not a private person.</p>
<p>A student is not entitled to a hearing with regard to dismissal for academic reasons from a public institution of public learning.</p>
<h1>Federal and State</h1>
<h2>The Supremacy clause</h2>
<p>provides that federaql law supersedes conflicting state law. Any state con provision or law that directly conflicts is void. However, there is a presumption against preemtion. So if a state has higher safety standards that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<h2>Commandeering</h2>
<p>Congress cannot </p>
<h2>General Welfare</h2>
<p>When congress spends and taxes to encourage bahavior. While Congress can&rsquo;t force legislatures to do things by commanding them, they can use their spending power to semi-coerce them. It cannot surpass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.</p>
<p>Conditions on the receipt of appropriations must be set out unambiguously </p>
<h1>Judicial Power</h1>
<p>A judge is absolutely immune from civil liability for judicial acts, including grave procedural errors. </p>
<h1>Presidential Power</h1>
<p>The president has exclusive power over the recognition of a foreign country</p>
<h2>Treaties</h2>
<p>Under the supremacy clause, a state is required to follow federal law when it conflicts with state law. A treaty that is not self-executing is not treated as a federal law for purposes of the Supremacy Clause unless it has been implemented through legislation. The president, acting on his own, cannot implement such a treaty.</p>
<h1>Registries and ex post facto</h1>
<p>Requiring people to register in with police as sex offenders or whatever is considered a safety regulation not an ex post fact punishment. A civil law will be treated in this way unless the punitive effect clearly overrides civil purpose.</p>
<h1>Regulation and Taxation</h1>
<p>The federal government and its instrumentalities are immune from taxation by the states. But a contactor working for the feds can be taxes on every part of what they do.</p>
<h1>Relations among states</h1>
<p>A discriminatory tax on an out-of-state business, even if authorized by Congress and therefore allowed under the commerce clause, may still violate the equal protection clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment if it does not satisfy the rational basis text. Promotion of local business by discriminating against nonresident competitiors is not a legitimate state purpose.</p>
<h2>Dormant commerce clause</h2>
<p>The Commerce Clause precludes any state from imposing laws that pose an undue burden on interstate commerce or prevent the free flow of interstate commerce</p>
<p>“State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce face ‘a virtually <em>per</em> <em>se</em> rule of invalidity.’” </p>
<p>we still must consider whether either State regime ‘advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.’</p>
<h2>National Guard</h2>
<p>National guard units are under the dual control of the federal and state governments. Under the Militia Clauses Congress has the power to authorize the President to call National Guard units to execute federal laws, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions. This includes domestic and non-emergency situations, and it not subject to the wishes of the state governor.</p>
<h1>Schools</h1>
<h2>Equal protection</h2>
<p>Because discrimination must be intentional in order to violate the constitution, only intentional (de jure) segregation in schools violates the equal protection Clause. A court cannot impose a remedy that involves multople school districts unless there is evidence of intentional segregation in each district. If there is no such evidence, a federal district court can only remedy constitutional violations (i.e. race discrimination) that occurred within a particular school district. Hence, the court can issue orders that aim to keep white students in the district schools or to attract white students in private schools within the district to its bublic schools. However, the court cannot seek to attract white students from surrounding suburbs into the district without evidence of discrimination in the suburbs.</p>
<h1>State Action</h1>
<p>The state connot impose a burden or deny a benefit solely due to animosity towards a class</p>
<h1>Standing</h1>
<p>Standing is found when: (1) the plaintiff suffers an injury in fact, that is concrete and specific to the plaintiff, (2) the harm is “fairly traceable” to the government’s action, and (3) the court has redress to remedy the injury.</p>
<p>A litigant generally has no standing to bring a lawsuit on behalf of a third party that is not in court. However, a notable exception occurs when there is a special relationship between plaintiff and third parties, such as a private school asserting its students rights to atttend.</p>
<p>In general, a taxpayer does not have standing to file a federal lawsuit simply because the taxpayer beleives the government has allocated funds in an improper way. There is a very narrow exception for a taxpayer suit challenging a specific legislative appropriation made under taxing and spending powers for violation of the establishment clause; however, this exception foes not apply when the government provides a tax credit.</p>
<h1>Welfare (and due process)</h1>
<p>The procedural aspect of the due process clause requires that a state grant notice and a hearing to welfare recipients before terminating benefits. </p>
<h1>Younger abstention doctrine</h1>
<p>The state shouldn&rsquo;t hear claims related to crimes currently being prosecuted in the absence of bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid state statute. </p>
<h1>Jobs</h1>
<p>A public employee who may be discharged only for cause has a property interest in her job and therefore is generally entitled to notice of termination and a pre-termination opportunity to respond unless there is a significant reason for their immediate removal. A formal pre-termination hearing is not required <em>if</em> there is notice, an opportunity to respond to the decision maker, and a post-termination evidentiary hearing. </p>
<h2>Seizures</h2>
<p>Generally, the government is required to provide the owner of real property with notice and a hearing prior to seizure of property pursuant to a forfeiture state. However, they are not necessarily required to provide notice prior to the seizure of personal property when there is strong justification for effecting the seizure prior to providing notice. For instance, a car that is known to transport illegal drugs needs no notice.</p>
<h1>Equal Protection</h1>
<p>Under the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment no state shall deny to any person the equal protection of the law. The Equal Protection Clause is implicated when the state decides to treat people differently. For most types of Regulation - economic, business, and regulatory - differences are tested under the rational basis test. Under the rational basis test, petitioner must prove the law lacks a rational basis and is unrelated to any legitimate objective. </p>
<p>For fundamental rights and protections, the state is subject to a higher burden to justify any regulations. This burden is known as strict scrutiny and requires regulations to be narrowly tailored and necessary for a compelling government interest.</p>
<p>Not legal to discriminate between in-state and out-of-state suppliers.</p>
<p>A disparate impact is not sufficient to trigger strict or intermediate scrutiny, proof of discriminatory motive or intent is required. </p>
<p>If discriminatory intent cannot be shown: rational basis review. </p>

<p>Congress has plenary power over aliens under Article I so a federal alienage classification is rational basis.</p>
<h1>Takings</h1>
<p>When a regulation results in a permanant and total loss of a property&rsquo;s economic value, a taking has occurred.</p>
<p>When the government takes property and the lein on the property becomes unenforcable due to sovereign immunity, that&rsquo;s a taking.</p>
<p>In determining whether a regulation constitutes a taking, the court will consider: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the property owner; (2) the extent to which the regulation interferes with the owner’s reasonable, investment-backed expectations regarding his use of the property; and (3) the character of the regulation, including the degree to which it will benefit society, how the regulation distributes the burdens and benefits among property owners, and whether the regulation violates any of the owner’s essential attributes of property ownership, such as the right to exclude others from the property</p>
<p>A local government may exact promises from a developer, such as setting aside a portion of the land being developed for a particular use or a demand for an additional expenditure, in exchange for issuing necessary construction permits. Such exactions do not violate the Takings Clause if there is an essential nexus between legitimate state interests and the conditions imposed on the property owner, and a rough proportionality between the burden imposed by the conditions and the impact of the development.</p>
<h1>1A Stuff</h1>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>In courtrooms</h3>
<p>The content of speech in a courtroom may only be restricted if it constitutes an imminent threat to the administration of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately imperil the administration of justice.</p>
<h3>The Media</h3>
<p>Restrictions on the right of the media to publish about matters of public concern and the right of the public to receive such information may only be restricted by government activity that is <em>narrowly tailored to acheive a compelling government interest</em></p>
<p>If there are less restrictive means of accomplishing the same end, those means should be used.</p>
<p>The media has no greater 1A rights than the general public.</p>
<h3>Government Employees</h3>
<p>When a government employee claims his free speech rights have been violated, they must show they were speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern.</p>
<h1>Public Forum</h1>
<p>The first amendment restricts most forms of content control for speech. Unless speech is less protected because it is commercial (intermediate) or unprotected (fighting words, incitement to violence) content controls are presumed invalid.</p>
<p>Public forums are those public areas traditionally set aside for exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Non-public forums may regulate by content but not viewpoint.</p>
<p>Even in public forums, time place and manner restrictions are allowed, as long as they are content and viewpoint neutral, leave alternative opportunities for the speech to take place, and are narrowly tailored to serve a significan state interest.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Churches can fire ministers for disabilities or for other impermissible reasons. Ministerial exception trumps other constitutional arguments.</p>
<h1>2A</h1>
<p>The second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected with militia service and to use those arms for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense within the home. It extends to all instruments that constitute bearable arms.</p>
<p>A statute cannot entirely ban handgun possession in the home. Nor can a statute require all handguns in the home be disabled.</p>
<p>The <em>Michigan</em> constitution is similar except it makes the individual right to bear arms for self defense more explicit. &ldquo;Every person has a right to keep and bear arms for the defense of himself and the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that firearm for traditionally lawful purposes. The Second Amendment right to bear arms is not unlimited. Examples of lawful regulations include imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms, as well as prohibitions on (i) concealed weapons, (ii) possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, and (iii) carrying guns in schools, government buildings, and other sensitive places are presumed to be legitimate. However, because it is a recognized fundamental right, this argument will force the court to apply strict scrutiny to the regulation in question.</p>
<h1>11A</h1>
<p>The Eleventh Amendment prohibits an action in federal court by a citizen of one state against another state when the basis for the action is the violation of state law.</p>
<p>Under the Younger doctrine, a court will not enjoin a pending state criminal case in the absence of bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid state statute. </p>
<h1>14A</h1>
<p>The section 5 enabling clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment permits congress to pass legislation to enforce the equal protection and due process rights guaranteed by the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment, as long as there is congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to acheive that end. Congress may override state government action that infringes upon 14A rights if the congruence and proportionality test is satisfied but it may not regulate wholly private conduct under this amendment.</p>
<p>There is no federal equal protection clause, but the fifth amendment due process clause includes the rights guaranteed by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment.</p>
<h1>21A</h1>
<p>States have the authority to prohibit the transportation or importation of alcoholic beverages into the state for delivery or use within the state. This can be delegated to the local governments.</p>
<h1>Presentment clause</h1>
<p>The presentment clause requires any bill that has been passed by congress to be presented to the president, who can sign or veto it. But there can be no line-item veto.</p>
<h1>Fundamental Rights</h1>
<p>Related persons, including extended family members, have a fundamental right to live together in a single household.</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<h1>Essay tips</h1>
<p>Start with standing</p>
<p>Standing is found when: (1) the plaintiff suffers an injury in fact, that is concrete and specific to the plaintiff, (2) the harm is “fairly traceable” to the government’s action, and (3) the court has redress to remedy the injury.</p>

            <p>
                A constitutional challenge of an ordinance or an enactment
based on vagueness is brought under the Due Process Clause of the
14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num002>2</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An ordinance or enactment is “void for vagueness” if what it
prohibits is “not clearly defined.”
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 An
ordinance must define the offense “with sufficient definiteness
that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and
in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement.”
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num004>4</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A person of ordinary intelligence should have a
“reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited” so he or she
may act accordingly. 
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are generally three ways an enactment (ordinance) can
be void for vagueness using the same criteria used to construe
statutes. These
are:
1. It does not provide fair notice of the conduct
proscribed.
2. It confers on the trier of fact unstructured and
unlimited discretion to determine whether an offense
has been committed.
3. Its coverage is overbroad and impinges on First
Amendment freedoms.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num004>4</a>
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There is the additional danger that a person may steer far
wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden
areas were clearly marked.
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A challenge for vagueness not on First Amendment grounds is
“examined in light of the facts of each particular case.”
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A ordinance can be void for vaugeness if it
    1. It does not provide sufficient notice as to what
conduct is required or prohibited; or
2. It allows arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
by the code enforcement officer.
