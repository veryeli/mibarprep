# Holder in Due Course Status

To aquire HIDC status, the instrument must satisfy the requirements of a negotiable instrument under the UCC. 

The holder must have taken the instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or that any party has a defense to payment on the instrument, Also when the instrument was negotiated to the holder, it does not bear apparent evidence of forgery to call into question its authenticity.

A HIDC takes the negotiable instrument free of any defenses by the maker. 

The HIDC must exercise ordinary care in paying and taking the instrument from an imposter so it does not substantially contribute to the loss.
