# Assault

The plaintiff's 

* reasonable apprehension

* of an imminent harmful or offensive bodily contact

* caused by the defendants action or threat

* with the intent to cause either the apprehension of such contact or the contact itself.

  # Excessive force

  In subduing a suspect, a poice officer may use a substantial level of force that may even result in injury to the suspect if the use of that force was necessary. To determine whether the amount of force used by a police officer was justified, the Court must determine whether the force was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Police officers must be given a wide degree of discretion in determining what type of action will best ensure the safety of the individuals involved, the general public, and the apprehension of wrongdoers. As such, if the force is determined to be excessive, then the governmental employee is liable in tort for the plaintiff's injuries. 

  # False Presenses

  i) obtaining title to the property

  ii) of another person

  iii) through the reliance of that person

  iv) on a known false representation of a material past or present fact

  v) and the representation is made with the intent to defraud.

  If a buyer actually relies on a separate assessment, false pretenses doesn't apply

  # Immunity

  A police officer, as a governmental employee, is immune from tort liability unless his conduct rises to the level of gross negligence.

  Michigan: under the governmental immunity act, a governmental employee is not liable in tort for personal injuries as long as the employees conduct does not amount to gross negligence that is the proximate cause of the injury or damage. Gross negligence is defined as conduct so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury results. For example, an officer is grossly negligent if the force used is excessive.

  

  # Products liability

  Products liability is governed by statute in Michigan. There are two possible causes of action under the statute. A plaintiff can sue for harm caused by a defective product or harm caused by the manufacturer or seller's failure to warn of a material risk. 

  A seller other than the manufacturer is only liable if one of the following conditions is met: either 1) the seller failed to exercise reasonable care, including breach of any implied warranty, with respect to the product and that failure was a proximate cause of the person's injuries, or 2) the seller made an express warranty as to the product, the product failed to conform to the warranty, and the failure to conform to the warranty was a proximate cause of the person's harm. 

  A manufacturer or seller is not liable in a product liability action for harm caused by misuse of a product unless the misuse was reasonably forseeable. Whether there was a misuse of a product and whether misuse was reasonable foreseeable are legal issues to be resolved by the court

  A misuse is statutorily defined as use of the product in a materially different manner than the product's intended use.  Misuse includes uses inconsistent with the specifications and standards applicable to the product, uses contrary to a warning or instruction provided by the manufacturer, seller, or another person possessing knowledge or training regarding the use or maintenance of the product, and uses other than those for which the product would be considered suitable by a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances.

  ## Failure to warn

  A defendant is not liable for failure to warn of a material risk that is or should be obvious (or a matter of common knowledge) to a reasonably prudent product user or persons in the same or similar position as the person upon whose injury or death the claim is based in a product liability action. The statute employs an objective standard and does not require manufacturers to warn of obvious material risks.

  # Proximate causation

  To succeed on a negligence claim, the plaintiff must prove proximate causation. Proximate cause exists when the defendant's actions aare a direct cause of the plaintiff's injuies, or, if an intervening force occurs between the defendant's act and the plaintiff's injury, the defendant still may be liable if the intervening force was forseeable. Medical malpractice is a foreseeable intervening force.

  # Public Nuisance

  In order for a private citizen to successfully maintain a public nuisance action, they must have a speical injury different in kind to that suffered by the general public.

  # Standard of Care

  A professional person is expected to exhibit the same skill, knowledge, and care as an ordinary professional in the same community.

  Innkeepers owe the highest duty of care.

  Children owe the care of a reasonable child of similar intelligence, age, education, experience.

  Generally, people owe the care of a reasonably prudent person.

  

* # Intentional interference with a contract

  Must prove that

  * a valid contract existed
  * the tortfeasor knew about it
  * the tortfeasor intentionally interfered, causing a breach, and
  * the breach caused damages

  Being a competitor grants greater latitude

  

  # IIED

  A defendant is liable for intentionally or recklessly acting with extreme and outrageous conduct that causes the plaintiff emotional distress

# Trespass to Land

Trespass to land occurs when the defendant's

* intentional act
* causes
* a physical invasion of the land of another.
  Intent required: to enter the land, not to perform an act that results in somethingunexpectedly entering the land.

# Vicarious Liability

A person who hires an independent contractor is not vicariously liable for their acts, but an IC making unsafe conditions on the person's property doesn't delegate their duty to keep their property safe, which is nondelegable.

The vicarious liability of a municipality for the torts of its employees is based on the doctrine of respondeat superior. Such liability generally can be imposed only where the individual tortfeasor acted during the course of his or her employment and within the scope of his or her authority.

# Negligence

 A negligence plaintiff must prove actual injury aka not just economic losses.

# Right to publicity

Misappropriation of the right to publicity is based upon the right of an individual to control the commercial use of his own identity. The elements are

i) the defendant's unauthorized appropriation of the plaintiff's name, likeness, or identity

ii) for the defendant's advantage, commercial or otherwise

iii) lack of consent, and

iv) resulting injury.

Mimicing a distinctive vocal pattern can be enough to incur liability (with the other elements.)

# Trespassers

Discovered trespassers are owed an duty to be protected from
* concealed dangerous artificial conditions
* that involve risk of death or serious bodily harm.

Undiscovered trespassers are owed no affirmative duty.

### IN MICHIGAN

A landowner owes no duty of care to an undiscovered trespasser except to refrain from injuring him by willful and wanton misconduct.

# Sports

In Michigan, participants in a recreational activity owe each other the duty to refrain from causing intentional or reckless injury.

A participant in a recreational sport can be liable to another participant for an injury only if the injury was inflicted recklessly or intentionally. 

## Attractive nuisaance

Five part test

 A possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to children trespassing thereon caused by an artificial condition upon the land if

(a) the posessor knows or has reason to know children are likely to trespass

(b) the posessor knows or has reason to know and realizes or has reason to realized the condition involves an unreasonable risk of injury or serious bodily harm to children

(c) the children because of their youth do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in intermeddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it, and

(d) the utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved and

(e) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.

## Negligent Infliction of emotional distrss

Requires physical manifestation

Duty of care is breached when the defendant creates a forseeable risk of physical injuty to plaintiff

If liability is predicated on physical injuty, plaintiff must prove they were in zone of danger.

Physical symptoms usually required - but can include physical shock.

Erroneous report of relative's death and mishandled corpse are NEID

## Nuisance
### Private nuisance
Interference with the use of enjoyment of another individual's property that must be substantial or unreasonable. If there's some utility to the interference, that reduces the probability of recovery.

## Strict liability

### Animals
Only applies to the owner of the animal, not owner of land where they're kept.

Strictly liable for fearful reactions, UNLESS the animal was properly in a pen.

## Defenses

### Private necessity
Applies when tort necessary to protect people from serious harm. Still responsible for actual damages, but not punitive or nominal damages.

# Intent

## Recklessness

One who is properly charged with recklessness or wantonness is not simply more careless than one who is only guilty of negligence. His conduct must be such as to put him in the class with the willfull doer of wrong. The only respect in which attitude is less blameworthy is that, instead of affirmatively wishing to injury another, he is merely willing to do so.

# Michigan Worker's Comp

Under Michigan’s Worker’s Compensation statute, employers pay for medical treatment for personal injury “arising out of and in the course of employment.”

To be considered disabled for purposes of workers compensation in Michigan, an employee must show that their maximum wage earning capacity in work suitable to their qualifications and training has been limited because of a personal injury or work related disease.

# Self defense

Must involve using reasonable force to defend against an offensive contact or bodily harm that they *reasonably* beleive will be intentionally inflicted upon them. A mistake is ok if it reasonable.

# Damages

## Personal Injury

All actual damages, past and future pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, reguction in future earnings capacity, loss of consortium.  In personal injury: no attorney's fees/

# Causation

Injury to rescuers is sufficiently forseeable to support proximate cause. Even if the chain of causation is lengthy.
