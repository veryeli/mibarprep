        <h1>Criminal Law</h1>
<h1>Accessory/Aiding</h1>
<p>The difference between an accessory before the fact and a principal in the second degree is presence. An accomplice who is present - like a getaway driver - is a principal in the second degree.</p>
<p>Mi - The purpose of the aiding and abetting statute is to permit conviction of a defendant of the principal offense whether he directly commits the act constituting the offiense or procures, counsels, aid, or abets in its commission. As aider and a</p>
<p>Majority approach: Accomplice liability does not depend on the principal being found guilty - they can even be found not guilty</p>
<h1>Attempt</h1>
<p>An attempt requires</p>
<p>i) a substantial step toward the commission of the crime</p>
<p>ii) the specific intent to commit the crimeConspiracy</p>
<p>Common Law - two conspirators, so a police officer + a person cannot = conspiracy</p>
<p>UCC - Wharton rule - one person conspiracy OK</p>
<h1>Defenses</h1>
<p>Mistake of fact may be a defense only if, e.g. someone beleived they were acting in self-defense when actually a gun was a toy.</p>
<p>Factual impossibility is not a defense.</p>
<h2>Insanity</h2>
<p>M&rsquo;Naghten: A defendant is not guilty if he does not know the nature, quality, or wrongfulness of his act because of his mental disease.</p>
<p>Irresistable Impulse: Lacked capacity for self control</p>
<p>Durham Rule: Unlawful act product of mental defect</p>
