        <h1>Michigan Bar Prep Essays by year</h1>

            Hi! I'm another 3L studying for the Michigan bar and I decided to organize all the essays by subject. Then I thought, why not share my work? It's pretty annoying if you want to study Creditors' Rights or whatever to wade through every test ever.
        </p>

        <p>
            So here's all the questions and answers (starting in 2009) organized by topic. I'd really like to add more resources (outlines, the rest of the tests so if you have any resources or capacity to help, *please* reach out - e.feasley@gmail.com). 
        </p>

        <p>
            All of these materials are from the Michigan Bar (thanks!) and are available <a href='https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/BLE/pages/admission-to-the-bar.aspx#test'>here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some other free resources are <a href='http://passthebar.com/'>Pass the Bar</a> and Themis's First and Second year essentials. I actually really like the Bar Prep Toolbox podcast. For things you're totally clueless about, like Negotiable Instruments, youtube can be pretty helpful. Especially if you like corny songs. Not free, but a lot of people on reddit seem to like 'Emanuelâ€™s Strategies & Tactics for the MBE' and the 'Critical Pass' cards which are both available on ebay. Honestly I think it's pretty much a travesty that the NCBE doesn't release more practice questions etc. for free. I'm using a paid prep service but if anyone wants to share free resources they're using, I'd love to post them.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Based on my bar prep so far, I'd like to point out that these materials are not meant to be fit for any particular purpose. There's no warranty! If you don't pass don't ask one of your friends that did to try to sue me. Also I just graduated from law school so I'm deeply in debt and basically judgement-proof.
