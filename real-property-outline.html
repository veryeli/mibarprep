<h1> Real Property</h1>
<h2> Easements</h2>
Under common law, an easement is an interest in real property that gives a person the right to use another's land for a specific purpose. An easement can be created by express grant or by operation of law.
<h3> Easement by Prescription</h3>
An easement by prescription is similar to aquiring property by adverse possession and requires the following elements: it must be adverse/hostle (no right or permission),must be continuous and uninterrupted for at least 15 years, and it must be open or visibl and notorious.
<h3>Overuse</h3>
When an easement is silent, its use cannot exceed the scope of or overburden the easement or it amounts to excessive use. In that case, the remedy is to stop the excessive use, not to terminate the easement.
