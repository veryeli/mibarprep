        <h1>Negotiable Instruments</h1>
<h1>Outline</h1>
<p>A negotiable instrument is an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, if the following apply</p>
<p>1) Must be payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder</p>
<p>2) must be payable on demand or at a definite time</p>
<p>3) Must not state any other undertaking by the person promising payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money.</p>
<h1>Holder in Due Course Status</h1>
<p>To aquire HIDC status, the instrument must satisfy the requirements of a negotiable instrument under the UCC. </p>
<p>The holder must have taken the instrument for value, in good faith, and without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or that any party has a defense to payment on the instrument, Also when the instrument was negotiated to the holder, it does not bear apparent evidence of forgery to call into question its authenticity.</p>
<p>A HIDC takes the negotiable instrument free of any defenses by the maker. </p>
<p>The HIDC must exercise ordinary care in paying and taking the instrument from an imposter so it does not substantially contribute to the loss.</p>
