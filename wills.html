        <h1>Wills</h1>
<h1>Outline</h1>
<p>The division of estates in Michigan is governed by the Estates and Protected Individuals Code (EPIC)</p>
<h1>Children</h1>
<p>Where the testator expressly disinherits a child, that child receives nothing. If a child living when the will is executed is not provided for they are effectively disinherited unlless the testator though they were dead. </p>
<p>A child born after a will is executed who is not provided for will receive a share of the estate equual in value to that which the child would have received had the testator died intestate, unless the will devised all or substantially all of the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.</p>
<p>But if there are other living children, the new child should receive about the same?</p>
<h1>Deeds</h1>
<p>Whether a legal document is a deed or a will turns on whether it conveys a present interest, in which case it is deemed a deed, or an interest on the death of the person who executed it, in which case it is a will. That determination depends on the intent of the person who executed the document. For wills and deeds alike, the intent of the drafter is gleaned from the instrument itself, the circumstances surrounding its creation, and the manner in which the parties subsequently dealt with it.</p>
<h1>Divorce</h1>
<p>Except as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument, court order, or contract relating to the division of the marital estate made between divorced individuals before or after the marriage, divorce, or annulment, a divorce or annulment of a marriage does all of the following....</p>
<p>a) Revokes all of the following that are revocable</p>
<p>i) a disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to his or her former spouse, and a disposition or appointment made to a relative of the divorced individual&rsquo;s former spouse.</p>
<h1>Formalities</h1>
<p>In Writing</p>
<p>Signed by testator</p>
<p>Signed by two witnesses within a reasonable time after witnessing the signature or the testator&rsquo;s acknowledgement of either the signature or the will.</p>
<h1>Intestate Succession</h1>
<p>Any part of a decedent&rsquo;s estate not effectively disposed of by will passes by intenstate succession to the decedent&rsquo;s heirs.</p>
<p>Things are evenly divided between full and half siblings.</p>
<p>A decedent by will may expressly exclude or limit the right of an individual or class to succeed to property of the decedent that passes by intestate succession</p>
<p>Where a decedent dies without a surviving spouse, their estate passes first to their decedents by representation. A &lsquo;child&rsquo; specifically excludes a stepchild and a foster child. There is such a thing as adoption by estoppel when a parent promises to adopt a child but does not. But this only applies with an actual promise.</p>
<p>A surviving spouse&rsquo;s intestate share is the first 100k plus &frac12; of the balance of the intestate estate if none of the decedent&rsquo;s surviving descendants are descendants of the surviving spouse. </p>
<h2>Post-will actions</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, when a person dies testate, spouses and children who are not provided for in the deceased&rsquo;s will may still be entitled to a share of the estate.</p>
<h1>Spouses</h1>
<p>The surviving spouse of a decedent who dies testate may elect either to abide by the will or to receive a share of the decedent&rsquo;s estate, which is referred to as the elective share. Specifically, the surviving spouse may elect to either 1) abide by the terms of the will or 2) take one-half of the sum or share that would have passed to the surviving spouse if the decedent had died intestate, reduced by one half of the value of all property derived by the spouse from the decedent by any means other than testate or intestate succession upon the decedents death.</p>
<p>A surviving spouse who married the testator after the will was executed is entitled to receive an intestate share of a specified portion of the estate. The surviving spouse&rsquo;s share is calculated by deducting that which is granted to a child of the decedent, so long as the child is not also the child of the surviving spouse. But they are not barred from the elective share.</p>
<h2>Property and allowances</h2>
<p>A spouse can claim exempt property and allowances: Homestead allowance, maintenance exemption, and household and personal effects allowance. A homestead allowance is in addition to any share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession or by elective share.</p>
<h1>Testamentary Capacity</h1>
<p>An individual 18 years of age or older who is of sound mind may make a will. The individual must be able to </p>
<p>1) comprehend the nature and extent of his property</p>
<p>2) recall the natural objects of his bounty</p>
<p>3) determine and understand the disposition of property which he wishes to make. </p>
<h1>Life insurance</h1>
<p>Life insurance proceeds are non-probate property and are governed by contract law.</p>
<h1>Undue influence</h1>
<p>a presumption of undue influence exists upon a showing of </p>
<p>1) the existence of a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the grantor and a fiduciary</p>
<p>2) the fiduciary or an interest they represent benefits from a transaction</p>
<p>3) the fiduciary had an opportunity to influence the grantor&rsquo;s decision in the transaction</p>
<p>A confidential relationship is one in which dominion may be exercised by one person over another. To establish undue influence,  it must be shown the grantor was subject to threats, misrepresentation, undue flattery, fraud, or physical or moral coercion sufficient to destroy free agency and impel the grantor to act against his inclination and free will.</p>
