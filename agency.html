                . An agency is
“a fiduciary relationship created by express or implied contract
or by law, in which one party (the agent) may act on behalf of
another party (the principal) and bind that other party by words
or actions.”
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                An agent’s authority to act may be either actual or apparent/ostensible.
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 “Actual authority may be express or
implied. Implied authority is the authority which an agent believes
he possesses.”
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Apparent authority may be found “when acts and
appearances lead a third person reasonably to believe that an
agency relationship exists.” While “all
surrounding facts and circumstances” must be considered in
determining whether an agent has apparent authority to engage in
an act that binds the principal, “[a]pparent authority must be
traceable to the principal and cannot be established by the acts
and conduct of the agent.”
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A  principal
can be estopped from challenging the authority of an agent
[w]henever a principal has placed an agent in such a
situation that a person of ordinary prudence, conversant
with business usages and the nature of the particular
business, is justified in assuming that such agent is
authorized to perform in behalf of the principal the
particular act, and such particular act has been
performed . . .
