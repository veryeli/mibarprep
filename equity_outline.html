<h2> Injunctive relief</h2>
<p>
	Under Michigan law, injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy that issues only <span class='quiz>when justice requires</span>, <span class='quiz'>there is no adequare remedy at law</span>, and <span class='quiz'>there exists a real and imminent danger of irreperable injury</span>.
</p>
<p>
	In determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the court must consider four factors; <span class='quiz'>whether (1) the moving party made the required demonstration of irreperable harm, (2) the harm the the applicant absent such an injunction outweighs the harm it would cause to an adverse party, (3) the moving party showed that it is likely to prevail on the merits, and (4) there will be harm to the public interest if an injunction is issued.</span>
</p>
<h3> Irreperable harm</h3>
<p> 
	The ability to show irreperable harm is an indispensable requirement. A plaintiff must demonstrate <span class='quiz'>a noncompensable injury for which there is no legal measurement of damages or for which damages cannot be determined with a sufficient degree of certianty</span>.
</p>

<p> 
	The loss of customer goodwill often amounts to irreperable injusty because the damages flowing from such losses are difficult to compute. But if it's just one single breach, like one sale, it probably doesn't rise to that level because it's easy to compute. Loss of fair competition resulting from use of confidential information in breach of a non-compete provision is also likely to be irreperable harm.
