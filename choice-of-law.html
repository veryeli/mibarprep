                In tort cases, Michigan courts use a choice-of-law analysis
called ‘interest analysis’ to determine which state's law governs
a suit where more than one state’s law may be implicated. Under this
analysis, Michigan courts will apply Michigan law unless a
‘rational reason’ to do otherwise exists.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In performing the interest analysis, the court first examines
whether any foreign state has an interest in having its law apply.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If no state has an interest in its law applying, the
presumption that Michigan law will apply cannot be overcome. If
a foreign state does have an interest in having its law applied,
the court uses a “balancing approach” to “determine if Michigan’s
interests mandate that Michigan law be applied, despite the foreign
interests
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A state has an interest in having its law applied if one of the parties is a citizen
    of the state where the wrong occurred
                
                    <a href=#num002>2</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The purpose of punitive damages is to
punish wrongdoing and deter others from engaging in similar
conduct, as opposed to compensating the plaintiff
