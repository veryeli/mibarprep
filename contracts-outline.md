# Charitable Donations

A promise to make a gift generally does not create an enforceable contract because there is no consideration for the promise. A promise of a charitable donation may be enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the Second Restatement provides that any charitable subscriptions promised in writing are enforceable under promissory estoppel even if the elements of reliance are not shown. But if it's not in writing, it's not binding.

# Conditions precedent and subsequent

Condition precedent: the plaintiff must prove an event did occur and so the defendant must perform

Condition subsequent: the defendant must prove an event did occur and so their performance was excused.

# Consideration

An essential element of a contract is legal consideration. There must be a benefit on one side, or a detriment suffered, or service done on the other. Courts do not generally inquire into the sufficiency of consideration. Rescission of the contract for inadequacy of consideration will not be ordered unless the inadequacy was so gross as to shock the sonscience of the court. It has been said a cent or pepper corn, in legal estimation, would constitute a valid consideration.

# Death

An offer terminates upon the death or mental incapacity of the offeror, even if the offeree does not learn of the offeror's death or mental incapacity until after the offeree has dispatched what he beleives is an acceptance. An exceptione xists for an offer that is an option, which does not terminate upon death because consideration was paid to keep the offer open during the option period, and the offer is therefore made ittevocable during that period.

# Definitions 

Course-of-performance: a sequence of conduct that is relevant to understanding an agreement between the parties if the agreement involves repeated occasions for performance and the other party accepts performance with knowledge and without objection.

Course-of-dealing: Conduct between parties based on another contractual relationship.

# Expiration of offer

An offer comes to an end at the expiration of the time given for its acceptance; an offeree cannot accept, either through words or deeds, an offer that has lapsed. An offeror cannot waive the lapseof his offer simply by choosing to disregard it. 

# Firm Offers

Reasonable amount of time unless until a date certian.
Must be from a merchant. Must be signed. It is irrevocable.

# Lack of contract term

A contract requires mutual assent or a meeting of the minds on all the essential terms. However, when the promises and performances of each party are set forth with reasonable certainty, the contract will not fail for indefiniteness; the absence of certian terms does not necessarily render a contract invalid. A contract may be enforced despite some terms being incomplete or indefinite so long as the parties intended to be bound by the agreement. So long as the essentials are definited by the parties themselves, the law supplies the missing details by construction.

# Material Benefit Rule

When a party performs an unrequested service for another party that constitutes a material benefit, the performing party can enforce a promise of payment made by a party who benefits from the service rendered. However, the material benefit rule is not enforced when the performing party rendered the service without the expectation of compensation - e.g. as a gif.

# Mitigation

Where one person has committed a tort, breach of contract, or other legal wrong against another, it is incumbent upon the latter to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages.

# Parole evidence rule

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
Parol evidence may be admitted to prove a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.

<h2>Modification</h2>
Under the common law, consideration is necessary to modify a contract but under the UCC only good faith.

<h2>Mailbox rule </h2>
When a rejection is sent first, and then an acceptance is sent, the mailbox rule does not apply, and first to be received by the offeror will control. 

When an acceptance is sent before a rejection, the mailbox rule applies.

# Quasi-contract

The equitable doctrine of restitution. Paying back for unjust enrichment. e.g. If a personal service is offered for a year, payable at the end, then the person receiving it dies after 6 months, both performances are excused but the provider can probably recover 1/2 of the price.

Even if someone would otherwise recover under quasi-contract, if they didn't actually benefit (e.g. subject matter of contract destroyed) they will not recover.

# Statute of Frauds

## Marriage

A contract made upon consideration of marriage

## Suretyship

A contract to answer for the debt or duty of another

## One year

Contracts that cannot be performed in one year because of the constraints of the terms of the agreement must be in writing. The year starts the day after the contract is made. Full performance by either party to the contract will generally take the contract out of the statute of frauds.

## UCC - $500 (MI: $1000)

Only applies to the sale of goods

## Real property

A contract for the sale of an interest in real property

# Third-Party Beneficiaries

## Vesting of rights for intended beneficiaries

Several ways but basically detrimental reliance.

<h2>Loans and acceleration clauses</h2>
A debtor in default can only be sued for the amount due so far if there is an exxeleration clause. Otherwise, it would be the amount due and outstanding.

<h2>Destruction</h2>
An offer involving something that is destroyed is terminated even without notice.



## Settlements

A settlement is only a valid contract if someone is giving up a legal right not to sue. If their claim was entirely without merit, the settlement offer can be rescinded.



# Installment contracts

Substantial performance generally suffices under the ucc.

If a seller makes a nonconforming tender under one segment of an installment contract, the buyer can reject only if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that shipment to the buyer and cannot be cured. If the seller makes adequate assurances, the buyer must accept.



Modification: if a party benefits from a condition, they can generally orally waive that condition without new consideration. But in an installment contract, the waiver can be retracted via adequate notice unless it would be unjust due to a material change of position by the other party in reliance on the waiver. 

# Objecting

If both parties are merchants and a memo sufficient against one party is sent to the other party, who has reason to know its contents, and the receiving party does not object in writing within 10 days, then the contract is enforceable against the receiving party even though he has not signed it.
