<h1> Professional Responsibility</h1>

Note: Not tested since 2016. I personally am not too worried about this, especially since folks will have covered the basics through MPRE study.

# Conflict

A conflict analysis should begin with who is the client. Many current-client conflict cases involve disagreements about whether the lawyer representing one member of a corporate family also reporesents other affiliates of the corporation so as to make it improper for the lawyer to handle unrelated adverse matter.

For a former client, the MPRC 1.9 conflict test is whether the prospective matter is materially adverse to the former client and the same or substantially replated to the former matter. 

However, if there is an ongoing settlement and a law firm is the contact, and the law firm takes no steps to disavow the relationship, the law firm still has the previous client.

The conflict test under MPRC 1.7(a) is whether the duties to a current client would materially limit the dutuies to another current client. If it is concluded it would not, the lawfirm must reasonably beleive the representation would not limit the dutues and must still get consent from the new client.

ABA adresses conflicts of interest that may arise in the corporate family context. The opinion observes that there is a split of authority, with some courts requiring disqualification and other courts denying disqualification when counsel for a corporate party files suit against a corporate addiliate. THe ABA opinion suggests consideration of the following factors:

1) whether legal work for one entity is intended to benefit all affiliates or entails collecting confidential information from all of them

2) whether counsel was engaged by or reports to officers of the other addiliate

3) whether the affiliate shared protected information with the lawyer with the expectation that the lawyer would use it in representing the addiliate, or for the purpose of furthering the representation

4) whether one affiliate is the alter ego of the other.
