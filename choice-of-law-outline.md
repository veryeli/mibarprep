# Analytic Framework

Michigan courts apply Michigan law unless a rational reason to do otherwise exists. In determining whether a rational reason to displace Michigan law exists, there is a two-part analysis. First, courts determine if any foreign state has an interest in having its law applied. If no state has such an interest, the presumption that Michigan law will apply cannot be overcome. If a foreign state does have an interest in having its law applied, we must then determine if Michigan's interests mandate that Michigan law be applied despite the foreign interests.

Under the governmental interest approach, states have an interest in applying their loss-shifting rules when doing so would benefit a state domiciliary.

The governmental analysis approach does not contain a public policy exception.

# Corporations

The primary factor in determining the domicile of a corporation is the state in which the corporation is headquartered.

# Contracts

Under Michigan law, when the state in which contract negotiation and performance take place are the same, the law of that state is presumed to apply.

In Michigan, parties may choose the law that will apply to contract validity if the state they choose has a substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction, or if there is some other reasonable basis for the choice. 

In general, parties are free to choose the law that will govern their contracts. The parties choice of law will still be rejected if application would be contrary to a fundamental public policy of the state with the most significant relationship to the issue.

There are several interests to consider as factors relevent to determining the applicable law in a contract case:

a) the place of contracting

b) the place of negotiations

c) the place of performance

d) the location of the subject matter of the contract

e) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of busness of the parties.

The prime objectives of contract law are to protect the justified expectations of the parties and make it possible for them to foretell with accuracy what will be their rights and liabilities under the contract. However, fulfillment of the parties expectations is not the only value in contract law, regard must also be had for state interests and for state regulation. The parties' expectations are best reflected by the negotiation and execution of the contract.

# Citizenship and Domicile

Domicile can be aquired by choice or operation of law. Domicile aquired by choice requires both a physical presence in the jurisdiction and intent to remain there indefinitley. The domicile of a corporation is generally its state of incorporation.

# Evidence

In cases involving evidentiary privileges, the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the communication should apply.

# Family Law

For a court to grant a divorce decree, at least one spouse must be domiciled in the state in which the court sits.

Bilateral divorce, ex parte divorce, and initial custody decisions are entitled to full faith and credit. A divorcing state's determination of domicile is not.

# Property

In cases that involve real property rights, courts generally accept the renvoi and look to the whole law of the place where the land is located including the choice-of-law rules there.

For moveable property, the decedents domicile at the time of death generally applies.

If a spouse in a community property state uses community property to purchase land in a separate property state, the land will still be community property.

# Residency

Under a Michigan choice of law analyses, a plaintiff's residency is determined as of the date of the injury. Plaintiff's residence, with nothing more, is insufficient to support the choice of a state's law.

# Statute of Limitations

Statutes of limitations are considered substantive in diversity cases.

# Tort

For a tort action for personal injury, consider

a) the place where the injury occurred

b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occured

c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties

d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.

The location state has an interest in conduct within its borders but if neither party is an Ohio resident the interest in litigation is minimal. This rationale holds true whether the parties are from the same state or different state. When it comes just to damages, the state where the thing happened has very little interest.
