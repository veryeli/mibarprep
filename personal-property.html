    <title>Personal Property</title>
</head>

        <h1>Personal Property</h1>
<h1>Bailment</h1>
<p>A bailment is created when the owner of personal property (the bailor) delivers his or her property to the posession of another (the bailee) in trust for a specific lawful purpose. </p>
<p>The obligations of a bailee depend on the nature of the particular bailment: whether the bailment is for the benefit of the bailee, for the benefit of the bailor, or both. When it&rsquo;s for mutual benefit, the bailer is bound to exercise ordinary care. Ordinary care of bailees includes surrendering bailed property only to the proper bailor. A showing that personal property was damaged or destroyed while in the possession of the bailee creates a rebutable presumption of negligence. </p>
<h1>Claim and delivery</h1>
<p>Replevin has been codified in Michigan and is referred to as a claim and delivery action. Such an action may be brought to recover posession of any goods or chattels which have been unlawfully taken or unlawfully detained and to recover damages sustained by the unlawful taking or unlawful detention. </p>
<p>Even a good faith recipient of property lacks title to that property as against the rightful owner.</p>
<p>This is subject to 4 exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>An action for replevin may not be brought by any person who does not have a right to possession of the goods or chattels taken or detained.</li>
<li>Property seized by virtue of an execution or attachment</li>
<li>Taken by cirtue of a warrant for the collection of a tax, assessment, or fine. </li>
</ol>
<h1>Reward</h1>
<p>One who finds lost property for which a reward has been offered may retain the property until such time as the reward is paid. Failure to permit an inspection does not waive a claim to the reward. It is incumbent upon the owner to prove ownership and at that time to pay the reward. If the finder maintains the property due to a legitimate doubt as to the owner, it does not affect a waiver of the reward nor does it give rise to a conversion claim.</p>
