        <h1>No-Fault</h1>
<h1>No-fault</h1>
<p><a href='https://www.michigan.gov/documents/cis_ofis_ip202_25083_7.pdf'>Explanation Document.</a>
In Michigan, damages for a person suffering an injury arising out of an automobile incident, regardless of fault, are governed by the Michigan No Fault statute. </p>
<p>Both the owner and operator of a motor vehicle are liable for an injury caused by the negligent operation of a vehicle if the owner expressly or impliedly consents or knows about the use of the vehivle. The facts of the case make clear that Danny negligently drove the vehicle and Carolyn consented to his use of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Under the statute, the injured party must first look to their own insurance company for benefits. Someone without no-fault insurance can then look to the insurance of relatives with whom they share a domicile. If there is no such relative, next look to the insurer of the owner of the vehicle, and next to the driver. If none of those is insured, then look to the assigned claims plan.</p>
<p>The person recovering can recover up to $20 a day for incidental expenses, up to 85% of salary.</p>
<h3> Non-economic damage</h3>
<p>Plaintiff can only recover non-economic damage if the injury caused death, disfigurement, or impairment of an important bodily function. Impairment of an important bodily function must be an objective impairment that causes an inability for the plaintiff the enjoy his or her normal daily life.</p>
<p>A detemination is based on the facts and circumstances specific to the injured person and a comparison of the injured person&rsquo;s life before and after the accident.</p>
<p>The Michigan Supreme Court has articulated a multi-step process for determining whether a plaintiff has reached the threshold for non-economic damages. The court must first determine if there is a material factual dispute conserning the nature and extent of the plaintiff&rsquo;s injuries. Second, the court must determine if an important body function has been impaired and if that impairment is objectively manifested. Finally, there is a multifaceted inquiry to determine whether the course of the plaintiff&rsquo;s normal life has been affected.</p>
<p>Michigan has abolished joint and several liability for most torts, however, that does not apply to no-fault. </p>
