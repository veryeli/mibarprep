<h1> No-fault</h1>
<a href='https://www.michigan.gov/documents/cis_ofis_ip202_25083_7.pdf'>Explanation Document.</a>
In Michigan, damages for a person suffering an injury arising out of an automobile incident, regardless of fault, are governed by the Michigan No Fault statute. Under the statute, the injured party must first look to their own insurance company for benefits. Someone without no-fault insurance can then look to the insurance of relatives with whom they share a domicile. If there is no such relative, next look to the insurer of the owner of the vehicle, and next to the driver. If none of those is insured, then look to the assigned claims plan.

The person recovering can recover up to $20 a day for incidental expenses, up to 85% of salary.

<h3> Non-economic damage</h3>
Plaintiff can only recover non-economic damage if the injury caused death, disfigurement, or impairment of an important bodily function. Impairment of an important bodily function must be an objective impairment that causes an inability for the plaintiff the enjoy his or her normal daily life.
