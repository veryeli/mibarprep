# Outline

A trust is defined as the right to the beneficial enjoyment of property to which another holds legal title. The property is held by the trustee at the request of the settler for the benefit of another person.

# Creating a trust

## Methods

Michigan recognizes five methods of creating a trust

i) when there is a transfer of property to a trustee during the settlor's life or by will or other disposition taking effect on the settlor's death

ii) when there is a declaration by the owner of a property that the owner holds identifiable property in trust

iii) when there is an exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee

iv) by declaring an inrrevocable trust

v) when there is a promise by one person to another person to hold property for the benefit of a third person

## Requirements

Regardless of the method chosen, a trust is created only if five statutory requirements are met

i) the settlor has capacity to create a trust

ii) the settlor indicates an intention to create the trust

iii) the trust either has a definite beneficiary, is a charitable trust, is a trust for a noncharitable purpose, or is a trust for the care of an animal

iv) the trustee has duties to perform

v) the same person is not the sole trustee and sole beneficiary

## Oral trusts

The Michigan Trust Code specifically permites the creation of oral trusts. The standard of proof for an oral trust is clear and convincing evidence.

For real property there must be an instrument, but for personal property oral declaration is sufficient.

# Carrying out a trust

Generally, the terms of a trust are to be carried out as nearly as possible in order to give effect to the intent of the settlor. While the terms of the trust normally prevail over the provision of the trust code, this is only true to the extent its purposes are lawful, not contrary to public policy, and possible.

# Discretionary trust provision

If there is a discretionary trust provision, creditors cannot collect until the debtor has received the trust distribution.

# Charitable trusts

A charitable trust is one that is created for the releif of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, the promotion of health, scientific, literary, benevolent, fovernmental, or municipal purposes, any purpose decribed in section 501(c)(3), or any other purposes the acheivement of which is benefivial to the community.

# Challenging a trust

Under the doctrine of election (also termed estoppel by acceptance) a beneficiary who elects to accept the benefits of a trust is thereafter barred from challenging the validity of the trust, including claims of insufficient capacity or undue inflience. 

A trust is void to the extent its creation was influenced by fraud, duress, or undue influence. This term has no exception for acceptance.

# Per stirpes

If a governing instrument calls for property to be divided per stirpes, the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving children of the designated ancestor and deceased children who left surviving descendants. Each surviving child, if any, is allocated 1 share. The share of each deceased child with surviving descenants is divided in the same manner, with subdivision repeating at each succeeding generation until the property is fully allocated among surviving descendants.



# Spendthrift clauses

A spendthrift provision is a trust provision that restrains either the voluntary or involuntary transfer of a trust beneficiary's interest. Spendthrift provisions are valid and enforcable in Michigan. But there are several exceptions, including when the claims involve

a) a trust beneficiary's child or former spouse who has a judgment or court order against the trust beneficiary for support or maintenance

b) a judgment creditor who has provided services that enhance, preserve, or protect a trust beneficiary's interest in the trust

c) Michigan or the US

But the court can only order all or part of the judgment satisfied only out of all or part of distributions of income or principal as they become due. 

# Testamentary Trusts

The primary goal in construing a testamentary trust is to effect the intentions of the settlers. Where there is no ambiguity, that intention is to be gleaned from the four corners of the instrument.
