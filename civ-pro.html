                Federal courts are courts of limited
jurisdiction, meaning they can only hear actions authorized by the
United States Constitution or federal statutes.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The two primary
categories of federal subject matter jurisdiction are when (1)
there is a either a federal question asserted in a well-pleaded
complaint that seeks a remedy based on the federal question or (2)
there is complete diversity of jurisdiction, which requires that
the action be between citizens of different states and the amount
in controversy exceeds $75,000. For “complete diversity” to exist,
no plaintiff can be a citizen of the same state of any defendant. 
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When determining an individual’s citizenship, a court will
look to the person’s domicile at the time the action was filed.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 A
person can have only one domicile for purposes of diversity
jurisdiction.
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A previous domicile cannot be lost until another is adequately
established
                
                    <a href=#num002>2</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Establishment
of a new domicile, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, is
determined by two factors: (1) residence in the new domicile, and
(2) intention to remain there.
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Diversity is determined at the time that the action is filed, and
based on the residency of the parties at that time. A change in
domicile by a party after that date does not destroy diversity. 
                
                    <a href=#num004>4</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Unlike an individual, a corporation is a citizen where it is
incorporated and where it has its principal place of business. 
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 A corporation’s
“principal place of business” for purposes of federal diversity
jurisdiction refers to “the place where the corporation’s highlevel officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation’s
activities.” 
                
                    <a href=#num006>6</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In determining the
amount in controversy, courts will accept the plaintiff’s good
faith allegations as to damages unless it appears to a legal
certainty that the plaintiff cannot recover that amount.
                
                    <a href=#num007>7</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 Federal courts have
subject matter jurisdiction to hear claims that “arise under” the
Constitution or other federal laws.
