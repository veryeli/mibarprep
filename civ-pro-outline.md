# Affirmitve Defenses

Pursuant to MCR 2.111(F) (2) (a) and MCR 2.116(0) (2), an affirmative defense must be pled no later than the party’s first responsive pleading. This can be accomplished by motion or the assertion of the affirmative defense in the answer as the first responsive pleading. MCR 2.116(D) (2). Failure to assert an affirmative defense in one of these two ways results in a waiver of that defense.

# Admissions

A defendant is presumed to admit everything they don't deny in their response unless it's about damages.

A reply to the defendant'sanswer is made only when the plaintiff is ordered to do so. The plaintiff is deemed to deny any allegations in the defendant's answer, including any affirmitive defenses, if not ordered to reply.

# Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy actions fall under the purview of federal law.

# Bulge provision

a federal court has personal jurisdiction over a party who is served within a U.S. judicial district and not more than 100 miles from where the summons is issued, even if state law would not otherwise permit such service. This special rule applies only to two types of parties: a third-party defendant who is joined under rule 14 and a required party who is joined under rule 19.

# Class Actions

Plaintiffs in a class action must satisfy four requirements: NCAT (aka nyan cat's pen name)

numerosity (so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticalble)

commonality (questions of law or fact that are typical to the class)

adequacy (representatives must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class)

typicality (the claims/defenses of representatives must be typical)

As long as one plaintiff in a putative class asserts a good-faith claim over $75,000, a court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.  In general, if any member of a putative class does not have a claim that meets the statutory jurisdictional amount, then the amount-in-controversy requirement is not met. If, however, at least one representative plaintiff in a putative class action has a claim that meets the statutory jurisdictional amount, other persons with claims that do not meet the jurisdictional amount can be made part of the class under the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction.

## CAFA

The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 does permit aggregation of claims, but in only in cases of 100 or more class members. 

## Michigan

In Michigan, there is a fith requirement: superiority. The class action must be superior to all other available methods of adjudication (N Cats)

factors to consider for superiority

whether separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications imposing incompatible standards of conduct or adjudications regarding some class members that would limit other's access to releif

whether final equitable or declaratory releif might be appropriate

whether the action will be manageable

whether in view of the complexity of the issues/expense of litigation, the separate claims of individual class members are insufficient in amount to support separate actions,

whether the amount that individual class members may recover will likely be large enough in relation to the expense and effort of administering the action

whether individual class members have a significant interest in controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions

In Michigan, a motion for certification of an action as a class action must be filed within 91 days after filing the complaint containing class-action allegations

A court may order that an action be maintained as a class action limited to specific issues or forms of relief. A court may also order the proposed class be divided into separate classes. A court may also revoke certification.

# Collateral-Order Doctrine

Under the collateral-order doctrine, a court of appeals has discretion to hear and rule on a district court order if it

i) conclusively determines the disputed question

ii) resolves an important issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action

iii) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment

A grant of immunity from prosecution - or the denial of such a grant - can qualify

# Complaint

A party alleging fraud or mistake must state with particularity the circumstances.

# Cross Claims

A party may voluntarily dismiss a cross-claim or counterclaim or third-party claim without the approval of the court or the consent of the parties before a responsive pleading is served, or, if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is introduced at a hearing or trial. The service of a summary judgment motion by a co-party does not cut off this ability.

# Counterclaims

A federal court may assert supplemental jurisdiction over a counterclam that does not satisfy the jurisdictional amount when the counterclaim is compulsory. However, a permissive counterclaim does not qualify for supplemental jurisdiction and therefore must satisfy the jurisdictional amount and the rule of complete diversity.

# Default Judgment

When a party has failed to plead or otherwise defend an action, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the court clerk must enter the party’s default. Once a default is entered against a party, the plaintiff may seek a default judgment. If the relief sought is a sum certain or an amount that can be made certain by computation, the default judgment can generally be entered by the court clerk on the plaintiff's request, accompanied by an affidavit showing the amount due. Otherwise, the plaintiff must apply to the court for a default judgment.

# Depositions

Unless parties agree:

Leave of court required to take a deposition before mandatory initial disclosures

Leave of court required to take more than 10 depositions each for plaintiffs and defendants collectively

Leave of court required to depose someone a second time

# Discovery

While experts who may testify at trial must be disclosed as part of the mandatory expert diclosure, experts employed in anticipation of litigation who are not expected to be called as a witness at trial need not be identified, abesent exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by any other means.

Generally, attempting to obtain evidence from the plaintiff without a court order and making a motion to compel are prerequisites to obtaining any sunctions under rule 37. Expenses cannot be awarded if the movant failed to make a good-faith effort to secure the information before filing the motion. 

## Michigan

Discovery is available in circuit courts after the commencement of an action. A civil action commences with the filing of a complaint. Additionally, interrogatories and requests for the production of documents may be served on a civil defendant with service of the summons and complaint.

The general rule governing discovery is that a party may obtain discovery on any matter as long as it is not privileged and relevant to the subkect matter involved in the pending action. Materials are discoverable even if they are not themselves admissible in court, as long as the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

## Michigan: medical records

Although medical records are ordinarily privileged under the statutory physician-patient privilege, the privilege belongs to the patient not the doctor. A physican is a custodian of the patient's medical records and must comply with a properly authorized request within 28 days.

## Michigan: Insurance

Even though information about liability insurance is precluded during trial, the amount or extend of insurance cov erage is a matter that affects the way a case may be prosecuted or defended, and so is relevant to the cause of action. A party may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of an insurance agreement under which a person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment

# Federal Statutory Interpleader

In order to file a federal statutory interpleader action, the stakeholder must be willing to either deposit the property at issue with the court or to post a bond in an appropriate amount. 

Unlike the typical federal court action based on diversity of citizenship, in which there must be complete diversity between each plaintiff and each defendant, diversity jurisdiction is met in a statutory interpleader action if any two adverse claimants are citizens of different states. 

For a federal statutory interpleader action, the amount in controversy need only be $500 or more, rather than the $75,000 otherwise required for a diversity action. 

Unlike the typical federal court action based on diversity of citizenship in which the federal court generally follows the rules regarding service of process of the state in which the court sits, nationwide personal jurisdiction by service of process is permitted with respect to a federal statutory interpleader action.

# Final Judgment Rule

An order granting a judgement is reviewable immediately as an answer of right

An order dismissing a third party defendant is not reviewable immediately

# Forum non conveniens

The common-law doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a court to dismiss an action if the court finds that the focum would be too inconvenient. To convince a court to invoke the doctrine the defendant bears a heavy burden. It is used primarily when the most appropriate forum is a foreign court.

# Impleader

When a defendant impleads a third party, the defendant is a third-party plaintiff and the third-party is now a defendant. Any counterclaims are compulsory.

For statuory interpleader, diversity jurisdiction is met if any two adverse claimants are citizens of different states. With regard to the amount in controversy, in a statutory interpleader action, the property at issue must merely be 500 or more in value.

# In Rem and Quasi in Rem

Satisfaction of the minimum contacts test is generally required for a court to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant. However, once a court with personal jurisdiction over a defendant renders a judgment, that judgment is enforceable by a court in another state by seizure of the defendant’s property located in that state, even if the defendant does not have minimum contacts with the state.

# Inadequate assistance of counsel

The right to counsel includes the right to be assisted by a reasonably competent attorney and extends to the defendants first appeal. The claimant has the burden to show that

i) counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and

ii) counsel's deficient perfomance prejudiced the defendant, resulting in the reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different.

Inexperience, strategy, choice of apellate issues, or failure to produce mitigating evidence have all been found insufficient to rise to the level of ineffective counsel.

When a lawyer's deficient performance costs a defendant an appeal they would otherwise have pursued, prejudice to the defendant is presumed with no further showing of the merits of the underlying claims. This is true even when the defendant as part of a guilty plea has waived the right to appeal.

# Inadvertant disclosures

Under the federal rule, an attorney’s inadvertent disclosure of a communication that is protected by the attorney-client privilege can operate as a waiver of the privilege when there is a failure by the attorney to promptly take reasonable steps to rectify the error. However, this rule does not apply when the disclosure was made in a state court proceeding and the applicable state law does not treat the disclosure as a waiver. When state law is more protective of the attorney-client privilege than the federal rule, applicable state law governs and the disclosure is not treated as a waiver in a subsequent federal proceeding. 

# JMOL

A motion for a judgment as a matter of law maybe made once a party has been fully heard on an issue at a jury trial. So the plaintiff may only make such a motion after the defendant showstheir side of the story.

# Juries

Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a jury verdict be unanimous.

## Instructions

A party can file a request for jury instructions on issues that could not have reasonably been anticipated by the time set by the court for such requests. The time a court sets for submission can be earlier than the close of evidence. 

# Pretrial Conferences

A court may direct counsel and unrepresented parties to appear for pretrial conferences for such purposes as expediting disposition of the action, effective case management, and facilitating settlement. If a party fails, the court may impose the same sanctions as permitted for failure to comply with a discovery order, including contempt of court or dismissal of an action.

# Presumptions

A rebuttable presumption that has not been rebutted is given preclusive effect.

# Remand

A remand order is generally not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, unless it is a remand order in a civil rights case, or a class action (and for a class action the application for review must be made not more than 10 days after the remand order.)

# Service of process

Under the federal rules, service may be made by following state law of either the state where the district court is located or the state where service is made.

According to FRCP an individual def't may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at their place of employment - even an administrative assistant.

## US Officers

A plaintiff must serve process on the US if the basis for the action is conduct that occurred in connection with duties performed on behalf of the US - even if the action is against a US officer or employer in their individual capacity. 

# Specific jurisdiction

When a defendant corporation is not subject to the general jurisdiction of the forum court, the corporation may still be subject to specific jurisdiction. When a cause of action arises out of or closely relates to a defendants contact with the forum state, specific jurisdiction may be warranted over that action even if that contact is the defendant's only contact with the dorum state.

# Summary Disposition

7: Judgement/dismissal/other relief is appropriate because of release, payment, prior judgement, immunity, statute of limitations/statute of frauds, agreement to arbitrate or litigate elsewhere, infancy or disability of moving party, or assignment or other disposition before commencement

In order for *res judicata* to apply, (I) the first action must have been decided on the merits, (2) the matter contested in the second action must have been (or could have been) resolved in the first action, and (3) both actions involve the same parties or their privies. Michigan courts apply *res judicata* broadly to bar not only claims already litigated, but every claim arising from the same transaction that the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, could have raised but did not. 

## 8: Failure to state a claim on which releif can be granted

## 9: Failure to state a valid defense





## 10: Failure to present a geniune issue of material fact

A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(1) tests the factual sufficiency for the complaint. In evaluating a motion for summary disposition brought under (c)(10) a trial court must consider the affidavits, etc in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. If the proffered evidence fails to establish a genuine issue regarding any material fact, the movant is entitled to judgement as a matter of law. Only substantively admissible evidence that is actually proferred in opposition to the motion may be considered. A pledge to establish an issue of fact at trial cannot survive summary disposition (unless it sets forth facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial). Conclusory statements are also not useful. 

## Appeal of summary disposition

The court of appeals cannot in reviewing a grant of summary disposition consider evidence that was not before the trial court.

# TROs and othe equity

Before a court can issue a temporary restraining order, the attorney of the party seeking the order must certify in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why notice should not be required. 

# Venue

Venue is proper in a judicial district in which a 'substantial part of the events or omissions' on which the claim is based occurred

This includes negotiating and executing a contract.

An action against a federal officer or employee acting in an official capacity or under color of legal authority may be brought in the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides.

## Removal

When removal is based solely on diversity jurisdiction, the action may not be removed if any defendant is a citizen of the state in which the action is filed. 

# International parties

Although generally the presence of an alien as a party in an action does not prevent the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship or alienage, a lawful resident alien who is domiciled in the same state as an opposing party serves to defeat alienage jurisdiction. 

# Sanctions

Sanctions must be limited to deterrence 

If a party fails to appear for a settlement or pretrial conference, the court may generally impose the same sanctions as those permitted for failure to comply with a discovery order. If it's an honest mistake, the least serious sanction is appropriate. That would be staying proceedings.



## Bad faith conduct

Assessing attorney's fees even if state law prohibits it. Even if the defendant DOES NOT request it.

## Clerical

The court may strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.

## Motions for sanctions

A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion, and must be served first to the opposing party. The opposing party must be given 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged pleading. If the safe harbor period passes and the opposing party fails to remedy, the party seeking sanctions may file the motion with the court.

## Sua sponte

the court may order an attorney, law firm, or party to show why conduct described in the order has not violated rile 11

A court cannot order one party to pay another's fees except upon motion. Except for bad faith conduct.

## Types of sanctions

Nonmonetary directives

An order to pay a penalty into court

An order directing payment to movant for part or entirity of reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses directly resulting from violation

### FOr failure to comply with a court order

Directing that the matters addressed in the order or other facts be taken as established

Prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses or from introducting designated matters into evidence

Striking pleadings in while or in part

Staying futher proceedings until order is obeyed

Dismissing action in while or in part

Rendering a default judgement

Treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order EXCEPT an order to submit to a physical or mental exam

Or any sanction that is just.

## Review

Sanctions are reviewed for abuse of discretion

The harshest sanctions - dismissal of action and entry of default judgment - are reserved for misconduct that is serious, repeated, contumacious, extreme, or inexcusable.

# Michigan: Case Evaluation

In general, case evalutaion is intended to force parties to make a serious evaluation of the merits of their respective cases and parties are aided in this assessment by a panel of independent lawyer/evaluators selected pursuant to MCR 2.404. The case evaluation rule imposes substantial sanctions for a party's improvident rejection of a case evalution reward.



A party may accept a case evaluation award. If the other party also accepts, a judgment will be entered in accordance with the evaluation and will dispose of all claims in the action.



If one party accepts and the other rejects, the rejecting party may be required to pay the accepting party's actual costs. Actual costs are costs taxable in any civil action and a reasonable attorney fee based on reasonable hourly or daily rate as determined by the trial judge for services necessitated by the rejection of the case evaluation.

If one party has rejected the case evaluation award, and the action proceeds to a verdict, that party must pay the opposing party's actual costs unless the verdict is more favorable to the rejecting party. The verdict must be adjusted by adding assessable costs and interest on the amount of the verdict ffrom the filing of the complaint to the date of the case evaluation and, if applicable, by making an adjustment for future damages.



Whether a verdict after adjustment is favorable is determined by comparing the v erdict to the case evaluation award. A verdict is more favorable to the defendant if it is more than 10 percent below the evaluation and it is more favorable to the plaintiff if it is more than ten percent above. If the evaluation is zero, a verdict reflecting that is more favorable to the defendant. 

# Michigan: Entry of a default

When served with a complaint, a defendant must serve and file an answer or take other action permitted by law or these rules within 21 days after being served with the summons and a copy of the complaint. A motion for summary disposition counts. A defendant may file an answer or take other action. Doing neither could expose them to defualt. A summary disposition motion can be filed at any time, including immediately.

# Michigan: Summary judgment

The Michigan Court Rules provide a precise description of the respective burdens that litigants must bear when a motion for summary judgment is fuled. The party seeking summary judgment must specify the issues for which it claims there is no genuine factual dispute. Provided the moving party's motion is properly supported, the opposing party must then respond with affidavits or other evidentiary materials that show the existence of a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, the rule provides that judment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him or her. Once a party is challenged as to the existence of the facts upon which he purports to build his case, the sum and substance of the summary judgment proceeding is that general allegations and notice pleading are not enough. Matters upon information and beleif and alleged common knowledge are not enough. The party must come forward with at least some evidentiary proof, some statement of specific fact upon which to base his case. If he fails, the motion for summary judgment is properly granted.

# MI: exams

MCL 2.311 governs physical and mental examinations of a party. MCR 2.311(A) states that wnen the physical condition of a party is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending may order the party to submit to a physical examination by a physician . This court order may be entered only on motion for good cause with notice, It may provide the arry for the person to be examined may be present,

A court may order as a sanction for failure to comply with an an order to provide or permit iscovery that the matter the order is about may be taken to be established for the purposes of the action. But if a nonparty does not comply, no sanction. 

No sanctions if no court order directing,,
