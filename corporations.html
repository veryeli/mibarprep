        <h1>Corporations</h1>
<h1>Piercing the Corporate Veil</h1>
<p>The law treats a corporation as an entirely separate entity from its stockholders, even where one person owns all of the corporation&rsquo;s stock. The traditional basis for piercing the corporate veil has been to protect a corporation&rsquo;s creditors where there is a unity of interest of the stickholders and the corporation, and where the stockholders have used the corporate structure in an attempt to avoid legal obligations.</p>
<p>There is no single rule for when the corporate entity may be disregarded. The courts consider all relevant facts in light of the corporations economic justification to determine if the corporate form has been abused. The Michigan Court of Appeals has used the following standard for piercing the corporate veil</p>
<p>1) The corporate entity is merely an agent or instrumentality of its shareholders or another entity</p>
<p>2) the corporate entity was used to commit a fraud or wrong, and </p>
<p>3) the plaintiff suffered an unuust loss or injury.</p>
<p>A plaintiff doesn&rsquo;t need to prove fraud and can pierce if it shows that the corporate defendant was defendant&rsquo;s agent, mere instrumentality, or device to avoid legal obligations.</p>
<h1>Business judgment rule</h1>
<p>Under the business judgment rule, absent any eidence of fraud, bad faith, or self-dealing there is a presumption that the directors of a corporation acted in good faith and in the honest beleif that the action taken was in the best interest of the corporation. In each case, a director&rsquo;s claim of good faith reliance will be measured by reasonable belief in the completeness and accuracy of information, the reliability and competency of the individual, or the committee&rsquo;s performance within its designated authority and in a way that the director beleives merits confidence.</p>
<h1>Close corporations</h1>
<p>In close corporations, shareholders often work for the corporation and dividends are often paid in the form of salary. Generally, shareholders in closely held corporations are also in a management position.</p>
<p>Employment and board membership are not generally listed among rights that automatically accrue to shareholders. Some states have enacted statutes that specifically protect the interest of minority shareholders in their capacities as employees and directors and some states without such statutes have protected these interests through court decisions. But not really Michigan.</p>
<h1>Derivitive Suit</h1>
<p>A derivitive proceeding is a civil suit in the right of a domestic or foreign corporation that is authorized to or does transact business in Michigan. Any recovery runs in favor of the corporation because the shareholders do not sue in their own right. They derive only an incidental benefit. If the defendants account, it must be to the corporation and not to the shareholders.</p>
<p>A shareholder may not commence or maintain a derivitive suit unless the shareholder</p>
<p>1) was a shareholder of the corporation at the time the act or omiission occurred</p>
<p>2) fairly and adequately represents the interests of the corporation in enforcing the right of the corporation, and</p>
<p>3) continues to be a shareholder until the time of judgment.</p>
<p>The shareholder must have the capacity to vigorously and conscientously prosecute a derivitice proceeding free drom personal interests which are anragonistic to the interests of similarly situated shareholders or the corporation. Other factors considered include the remedy sought, indications the plaintiff is not the true party in interest, the plaintiff&rsquo;s unfamiliarity with the litigation, pending litigation between the plaintiffs and defendants, plaintiffs vincdictiveness toward the defendants, and the degree of support from other shareholders.</p>
<p>A derivitice action may not be initiated until </p>
<p>1) a written demand has been made upon the corporation to take suitable action and</p>
<p>2) 90 days have passed from the date the demand was made unelss the shareholder has earlier been notified that the demand has been rejected by the corporation or unless itteperable injiry to the corporation would result by waiting for the expiration of the 90 day period.</p>
<h2>Attorney fees</h2>
<p>Under the american rule, attorney fees generally are not recoverable from the losing party absent and exception set forth in a statute or court rule expressly authorizing such an award. But there is sich an exception. At the conclusion of a derivitive proceeding, a court <em>may</em> order the corporation to pay the plaintiffs reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred in the proceeding if it finds that the proceeding has resulted in a substantial benefit to the corporation.</p>
<p>The shareholder must account to the corporation for any proceeds received in excess of expenses awarded by the court, but not for a judgment rendered for the benefit of an injured shareholder only and limited to a recovery of the loss or damage sustained by him or her.</p>
<p>In other words, the amount awarded in excess of reasonable expenses and fees is returned to the corporation.</p>
<h1>Distributions</h1>
<p>The board of directors may authorize and a corporation may make distributions, unless the articles of incorporation otherwise restrict this authority. Distributions are transfers of money or other property to or for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes a cash dividend. </p>
<p>The Michigan Business Corporation act imposes restrictions on the payment of distributions. A distribution shall not be made if the corporatoin would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business (equity insolvency test) or the corporation&rsquo;s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time as of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. (balance sheet test)</p>
<p>There is joint and several liability upon directors who vote for or concur in the declaration of a distribution to shareholders contrary to the MBCE or restrictions in a corporations areticles of incorporation. However, a director who otherwise faces liability is afforded protection if he or she acted with the duties of good faith and due care, and acted as a reasonably prudent person, and had a reasonable beleif that the actions were taken in the best interests of the corporation.</p>
<p>In discharging his or her duties as a director, a director may rely upon information presented by directors, officers, or employees who are reasonbly beleived to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, by legal counsel, accountants, engineers or other persons as to matters reasonably beleived to be within the person&rsquo;s professional or expert competence, or by a committee of the board which is reasonably beleived to merit confidence. Reliance, however, is not permitted if the director or officer has knowledge that would make reliance unwarranted.</p>
<h1>Shareholder Rights</h1>
<p>Some states have also adopted a “reasonable expectations test” as a guide to defining “oppression”. Not really Michigan though&hellip;</p>
