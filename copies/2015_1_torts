2015 Question 1


<container class="question">
Dan Defendant was walking down a crowded sidewalk in Anytown, USA and saw Polly Plaintiff walking towards him. Dan had seriously disliked Polly since they were both in middle school, and in the many years since then he had always wanted to get back at her for the mean and embarassing comments she made to others about him. Now was his chance. As she approached, he screamed out "Polly, you are a pristitute, is your husband still your pimp?" After that, he yelled a few more innocuous things at her as they walked futher away from each other.

Polly was neither fazed nor traumatized by the event. Instead, she laughed it off as a prank by a still immature Dan. However, a few days later Polly ran into two friends, who had witnessed the event and heard Dan's comments. The friends said they were embarrassed for her, and thought his words made her look bad. Thought she did not believe anyone would think she was actually a prostitute, Polly also did not want to appear weak. Polly therefore brought a slander claim against Dan, arguing that his statement caused her emotional distress and humiliation. She asked for an aware of $1,000,000, $950,000 of which was for punitive damages.

<container class="prompt">Dan argues that: (1) Polly cannot succeed on the slander claim because she cannot establish a prima facie case, and (2) Polly is not entitled to punitive damages. Explain whether Dan's arguments are correct. </container>

<container class="answer">

The first issue is whether Polly can establish a prima facie case of slander. The elements are: (1) a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff, (2) an unprivileged communitication to a third party, (3) fault amounting to at least negligence of the part of the statemenet irrespective of special harm (defamation per se) or the existence of special harm caused by publication. <i> Mitan v Campbell, 474 Mich 21, 24 (2005). </i>

<br>

Polly will have no trouble proving the elements of slander. First, Dan made a statement about Polly -- that she was a prostitute, with the not so subtle accusation that her husband was her pimp. Although the second clause of Dan's statement was somewhat in the form of a question, overall the statement was defamatory because it tended to harm Polly's reputiotion in the estimation of the communitiy. <i> Rouch v Enquirer & News, 440 Mich 238, 251 (1992). Additionally, there is nothing to suggest that this was at all true, <i>Wilson v Sparrow Hosp, 290 Mich App 149, 155 (2010) (truth is an absolute defense to defamation claim), and the facts show that Dan tried to come up with the most outrageous accusation. Second, Dan's statement was not privileges, and it was communicated to many people on the sidewalk, including two of Polly's friends. Thirs, because Polly is a private individual, she must prove that Dan was negligent in publishing the statement. MCL 600.2911(7). She can easily do so, as the facts indicate that Dan simply created an outlandish story about Polly for the sole purpose of revenge and embarassment. Finally, because Dan accused Polly of lack of chastity, she does not need to prove special harm, as the statement is actionable by itself. MCL 600.2911(1), Linebaugh v Sheraton Michigan Corp, 198 Mich App 335, 338-339 (1993). The fact that she may have laughed off the incident at first is therefore irrelevant. Some applicants may raise the possibility that Don's statement may not be defamatory because it is "rhetorical hyperbole", on the basis that it could only be seen as loose language or something not meant as an actual assertion of fact. <i>Ghanam v Does<i>, 303 Mich App 552, 545-546 (2014).

<br>

Thus, the applicant should conclude that Polly can establish a prima facie case of slander.

<br>

The second question is whether Polly can recover punitive damages. She cannot. According to several statutory provisions, in this private plaintiff slander case Polly is not entitled to an award of punitive damages. MCL 600.2911(2)(a) states that, except as described in (2)(b) (involving libel claims only), a libel or slander plaintiff is only entitled to recover actual damages. Although a private plaintiff can recover actual damages under this subsection if she proves actual malice, <i> Glazer v Lamkin</i>, 201 Mich App 432, 436-437 (1993), the subsection does not list punitive damages as being recoverable. Additionally, MCL 600.2911(7) provides that recovery for a successful private plaintiff is limited to economic damages. Consequently, despite the evidence of Dan's milice in publishing the statement, Polly is not entitled to an award of punitive damages. <i>Peisner v Detroit Free Press</i>, 421 Mich 125, 130-133 (1984).

<br>

To the extent that applicants may assert that Polly is not entitled to punitive damages because she never requested that Dan issue a retraction, Michigan law has been construed such that retractions only apply to liber committed by media defendants. See <i> Brantley v Zantop International Airlines</i>,  617 F Supp 1032, 1035-1036 (ED Mich, 1985), interpreting MCL 600.2911(2)(b).
