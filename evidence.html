    <title>Evidence</title>
</head>

        <h1>Evidence</h1>
<h1>Authentication</h1>
<p>Photographs are not admitted without a proper showing that they accurately represent the subject matter of the photograph. Someone familiar with the scene can provide the required foundation by testifying from personal knowledge to its accuracy. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be the photographer</p>
<p>X-ray images, electrocardiograms, and similar items are physical representations of things that cannot otherwise be seen (i.e., the inner workings and functionality of a human body), and, as such, unlike other reproductions, they cannot simply be authenticated by the testimony of a witness claiming that they are accurate reproductions of the facts. To authenticate such an item, it must be shown that an accurate process was used, that the machine used was working properly, and that the operator of the machine was qualified to operate it. The chain of custody must also be established.</p>
<h1>Best evidence rule</h1>
<p>Only applies to writings, recordings, or photographs including electronic documents, x-rays, and videos. Bad faith destruction raises the presumption that such evidence would have been unfavorable to the party destroying it.</p>
<p>Only applies if the testator got their information through the recording. If there&rsquo;s a tape of a conversation the testator was present at, best evidence does not apply.</p>
<h1>Character</h1>
<p>Generally, in a civil case, evidence of a person&rsquo;s character or character trait is not admissible to prove they acted in accordance with that trait on a particular occasion. However, evidence concerning past sexual assault or child molestation by a defendant is admissible in a civil case where the claim for relief is based on a defendant&rsquo;s sexual misconduct.</p>
<h2>Homicide</h2>
<p>Although the prosecution generally may offer rebuttal evidence of the victim&rsquo;s good character only after the defendant has introduced evidence of the victim&rsquo;s bad character, the prosecution on a homicide case may offer evidence of a victim&rsquo;s peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.</p>
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>A prosecutor may not argue the effect of testimony that was not entered into evidence at trial. </p>
<p>A prosecutor also cannot vouch for the credibility of facts and evidence not in the case - including what the defendant told the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Without a curative instruction this argument is error and would standing alone probably result in a reversal of the conviction.</p>
<p>Impeaching a witness can only happen through the witnesses testimony. For instance, if witness X says Y, the prosecutor can say &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you tell officer Z &lsquo;not Y&rsquo;?&rdquo; But cannot call officer Y to the stand and say &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t witness X tell you &lsquo;not Y&rdquo; </p>
<h1>Exclusionary rule</h1>
<p>The primary remedy for 4<sup>th</sup> amendment violations is the exclusionary rule which prevents the introduction at a subsequent criminal trial of evidence unlawfully seized. The remedy generally only applies to criminal trials and is not applicable to civil proceedings.</p>
<h1>Habit</h1>
<p>Habit evidence need not be corroborated or have an eyewitness. But the evidence must be sufficiently specific. A terndency to cross the street carelessly is likely not a sufficiently regular response to a particular situation to qualify as a habit.</p>
<h1>Identification</h1>
<p>A witnesses prior out of court identification of a person after perceiving that person is not hearsay and is admissibel as substantive evidence if the witness (i) testifies as the present trial or hearing, and (ii) is subject to cross-examination. Even if the witness ahs no memory of the propr identification, it will be admissible if they are subject to cross-examination.</p>
<h1>Juror Information</h1>
<p>Extraneous prejudicial information not admitted at trial may support a motion for a new trial. Misunderstanding instructions, relying on stricken evidence, or something like a threat on their life is not applicable.</p>
<h1>Lay Witnesses</h1>
<p>A layperson may provide opinion testimony if the opinion is within the general competence of a layperson, is rationally based on the perception of the witness, and if they testimony is helpful to the determination of a fact in issue.</p>
<h1>Leading questions</h1>
<p>Although the suggestive powers of leading questions are generally considered undesirable, they ore ordinarily allowed during cross. But if cross is cross in form only, like when a party is cross-examined by their own lawyer, it is too suggestive.</p>
<h1>Past convictions</h1>
<p>If a criminal defendant testifies, they are subject to cross-examination and impeachment, which can include questions about past crimes under some circumstances.</p>
<p>If more than 10 years have elapsed sence the conviction or release from confinement, whichever is later, a conviction is admissible only if the probative value of the convction <em>substantially outweighs</em> its prejudicial effect. If it was less than ten years, the limitation does not apply. If the conviction does not involve dishonest or false statements and the witness is a criminal defendant, evidence of the conviction is admissible only if its probative value outweights the prejudicial effect. </p>

<h1>Plea Negotiations and. settlements</h1>
<p>If a defendant knowingly and voluntarily in the presence of counsel waives their right to have statements made during a plea negotiation used, it is waived.</p>
<p>Evidence of a settlement offer, including evidence of the acceptance of such an offer, is not admissible for the purpose of establishing the validity of a claim or the amount of damages.</p>
<h1>Prior Inconsistent Statements</h1>
<p>A prior inconsistent statement made under oath at a trial, hearing or deposition is considered non hearsay and is admissible to impeach the declarants credibility and as substantive evidence - even if it wasn&rsquo;t the same parties.</p>
<h1>Recollection Refreshed</h1>
<p>Any item can be used to refresh recollection. When the item is a writing, the adverse party is entitiled to have the document produced, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about it, and to introduce any relevant portion into evidence.</p>
<h1>Evidence admissibility hearings</h1>
<p>The trial judge generally decides preliminary questions regarding the competency of evidence, including the admissibility of evidence, whether privilege exists, and whether a person is qualified to be a witness. Hearings on preliminary matters must be conducted outside the presence of the jury when the hearing involves the admissibility of confessions, when a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests, or when justice requires it. </p>
<h1>Judicial Notice</h1>
<p>A court may take judicial notice at any time during a proceeding including on appeal, sua sponte or on request. But even a fact there is judicial notice of, a jury cannot be required to accept as conclusive in a criminal trial.</p>
<h1>Spouses</h1>
<p>The general rule is that the spouse of a criminal defendant may not be called as a witness by the prosecution. Not may a married person be compelled to testify against their spouse in any criminal proceedings. In federal and most state courts, the witness-spouse holds the privilege and may choose to testify but cannot be compelled to do so.</p>
<h1>Exceptions to Hearsay</h1>
<h2>Statements against interest</h2>
<p><em>Only applies when the declarant is unavailable</em></p>
<p>The general rule for statements against interest made by an unavailable declarant is that a statement qualifies as a hearsay exception if, at the time it was made, (i) it was against the declarantâ€™s pecuniary, proprietary, civil, or penal interest, and (ii) the statement was of a nature such that a reasonable person would not have made it unless she believed it to be true. </p>
<p>Even if the statement is just made to buddies while boasting. A statement that could subject the declarant to criminal liability is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</p>
<h2>Knowledge of an existing condition</h2>
<p>If someone says something like &lsquo;I should have had that step repaired&rsquo; is is not hearsay to admit it to prove they knew the step was dangerous, but it is not admissible to prove they &lsquo;should have had the step repaired&rsquo;</p>
<h1>Nonhearsay</h1>
<h2>Answers to interogatories</h2>
<p>Answers to interrogatories, which are signed and made under oath by a party to the litigation, are nonhearsay admissions.</p>
<h2>Statements of opposing parties</h2>
<p>A statement made by a party to the current litigation is not hearsay if it is offered by an opposing party.</p>
<h2>Adoptive admissions</h2>
<h1>Former testimony VS prior inconsistent statement</h1>
<p>The former testimony exception does not apply to grand jury testimony. To be admissible, the former testimony of an unavailable witness must be given under oath in a hearing or deposition, and the party against whom the testimony is being offered must have had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct or cross-examination; grand jury testimony does not meet this standard because the defendant does not have the opportunity to cross-examine grand jury witnesses.</p>
