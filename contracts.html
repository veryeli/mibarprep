                Neither law nor
equity will enforce a contract that is in violation of public
policy. Contracts in violation of public policy are void and unenforceable.

            <p>
                Public policy is be found in statutes and when they have not directly spoken, then in the
decisions of the courts and in constitutions
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
                    <a href=#num004>4</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 Under
the doctrine of severability, “[a]n unlawful term in a contract is
severable from the whole unless that term is central to the
parties’ agreement. Hence, the failure of a distinct part of a
contract does not void valid, severable provisions.”
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>
                
                    <a href=#num006>6</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a general rule, a contract is entire when, by its
terms, nature and purpose, it contemplates that each and
all of its parts are interdependent and common to one another and to the consideration, and is severable when,
in its nature and purpose, it is susceptible of division
and apportionment.

The singleness or apportionability of the consideration
appears to be the principal test. The question is
ordinarily determined by inquiring whether the contract
embraces one or more subject matters, whether the
obligation is due at the same time to the same person,
and whether the consideration is entire or apportioned.
                
                    <a href=#num007>7</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When the price is expressly
apportioned by the contract . . . to each item to be performed,
the contract will generally be held to be severable.
                
                    <a href=#num007>7</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Michigan, a person who is a nonparty to a contract may
be entitled to sue to enforce the contract as a third-party
beneficiary.
                
                    <a href=#num008>8</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any person for whose benefit a promise is made by way of
contract . . . has the same right to enforce said promise
that he would have had if the said promise had been made
directly to him as the promisee. (1) A promise shall be construed to have been made for
the benefit of a person whenever the promisor of said
promise had undertaken to give or to do or refrain from
doing something directly to or for said person.
                
                    <a href=#num009>9</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not just any person who benefits
from a contract may enforce it. Rather, it states that a person is
a third-party beneficiary of a contract only when the promisor
undertakes an obligation ‘directly’ to or for the person.
                
                    <a href=#num010>10</a>
                
                    <a href=#num011>11</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Contracting parties must be “clearly
aware that the scope of their contractual undertakings encompasses
a third party, directly referred to in the contract, before the
third party is able to enforce the contract.”
                
                    <a href=#num010>10</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard for
determining whether a person is a third-party beneficiary is an
objective standard and must be determined from the language of the
contract only.
                
                    <a href=#num010>10</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only intended beneficiaries, not incidental
beneficiaries, may enforce a contract under 1405. A third person cannot
maintain an action on a simple contract merely because he or she
would receive a benefit from its performance or would be injured
by its breach.
