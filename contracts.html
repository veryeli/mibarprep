        <h1>Contracts</h1>
<h1>Charitable Donations</h1>
<p>A promise to make a gift generally does not create an enforceable contract because there is no consideration for the promise. A promise of a charitable donation may be enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel and the Second Restatement provides that any charitable subscriptions promised in writing are enforceable under promissory estoppel even if the elements of reliance are not shown. But if it&rsquo;s not in writing, it&rsquo;s not binding.</p>
<h1>Conditions precedent and subsequent</h1>
<p>Condition precedent: the plaintiff must prove an event did occur and so the defendant must perform</p>
<p>Condition subsequent: the defendant must prove an event did occur and so their performance was excused.</p>
<h1>Consideration</h1>
<p>An essential element of a contract is legal consideration. There must be a benefit on one side, or a detriment suffered, or service done on the other. Courts do not generally inquire into the sufficiency of consideration. Rescission of the contract for inadequacy of consideration will not be ordered unless the inadequacy was so gross as to shock the sonscience of the court. It has been said a cent or pepper corn, in legal estimation, would constitute a valid consideration.</p>
<h1>Death</h1>
<p>An offer terminates upon the death or mental incapacity of the offeror, even if the offeree does not learn of the offeror&rsquo;s death or mental incapacity until after the offeree has dispatched what he beleives is an acceptance. An exceptione xists for an offer that is an option, which does not terminate upon death because consideration was paid to keep the offer open during the option period, and the offer is therefore made ittevocable during that period.</p>
<h1>Definitions</h1>
<p>Course-of-performance: a sequence of conduct that is relevant to understanding an agreement between the parties if the agreement involves repeated occasions for performance and the other party accepts performance with knowledge and without objection.</p>
<p>Course-of-dealing: Conduct between parties based on another contractual relationship.</p>
<h1>Expiration of offer</h1>
<p>An offer comes to an end at the expiration of the time given for its acceptance; an offeree cannot accept, either through words or deeds, an offer that has lapsed. An offeror cannot waive the lapseof his offer simply by choosing to disregard it. </p>
<h1>Firm Offers</h1>
<p>Reasonable amount of time unless until a date certian.
Must be from a merchant. Must be signed. It is irrevocable.</p>
<h1>Lack of contract term</h1>
<p>A contract requires mutual assent or a meeting of the minds on all the essential terms. However, when the promises and performances of each party are set forth with reasonable certainty, the contract will not fail for indefiniteness; the absence of certian terms does not necessarily render a contract invalid. A contract may be enforced despite some terms being incomplete or indefinite so long as the parties intended to be bound by the agreement. So long as the essentials are definited by the parties themselves, the law supplies the missing details by construction.</p>
<h1>Material Benefit Rule</h1>
<p>When a party performs an unrequested service for another party that constitutes a material benefit, the performing party can enforce a promise of payment made by a party who benefits from the service rendered. However, the material benefit rule is not enforced when the performing party rendered the service without the expectation of compensation - e.g. as a gif.</p>
<h1>Mitigation</h1>
<p>Where one person has committed a tort, breach of contract, or other legal wrong against another, it is incumbent upon the latter to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages.</p>
<h1>Non-compete agreements</h1>
<p>Non-compete agreements are valid and enforceable in Michigan so long as they <span class='quiz'>are reasonable in duration and geographical area.</span> Time periods as long as <span class='quiz'> three years</span> have been upheld. Radiuses of up to <span class='quiz'> 25 miles </span> have been upheld. Enforcement of valid noncompete agreements is in the public interest. </p>
<h1>Parole evidence rule</h1>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Parol evidence may be admitted to prove a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.</p>
<h2>Modification</h2>
<p>Under the common law, consideration is necessary to modify a contract but under the UCC only good faith.</p>
<h2>Mailbox rule </h2>
<p>When a rejection is sent first, and then an acceptance is sent, the mailbox rule does not apply, and first to be received by the offeror will control. </p>
<p>When an acceptance is sent before a rejection, the mailbox rule applies.</p>
<h1>Quasi-contract</h1>
<p>The equitable doctrine of restitution. Paying back for unjust enrichment. e.g. If a personal service is offered for a year, payable at the end, then the person receiving it dies after 6 months, both performances are excused but the provider can probably recover &frac12; of the price.</p>
<p>Even if someone would otherwise recover under quasi-contract, if they didn&rsquo;t actually benefit (e.g. subject matter of contract destroyed) they will not recover.</p>
<h1>Statute of Frauds</h1>
<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p>A contract made upon consideration of marriage</p>
<h2>Suretyship</h2>
<p>A contract to answer for the debt or duty of another</p>
<h2>One year</h2>
<p>Contracts that cannot be performed in one year because of the constraints of the terms of the agreement must be in writing. The year starts the day after the contract is made. Full performance by either party to the contract will generally take the contract out of the statute of frauds.</p>
<h2>UCC - $500 (MI: $1000)</h2>
<p>Only applies to the sale of goods</p>
<h2>Real property</h2>
<p>A contract for the sale of an interest in real property</p>
<h1>Third-Party Beneficiaries</h1>
<h2>Vesting of rights for intended beneficiaries</h2>
<p>Several ways but basically detrimental reliance.</p>
<h2>Loans and acceleration clauses</h2>
<p>A debtor in default can only be sued for the amount due so far if there is an exxeleration clause. Otherwise, it would be the amount due and outstanding.</p>
<h2>Destruction</h2>
<p>An offer involving something that is destroyed is terminated even without notice.</p>
<h2>Settlements</h2>
<p>A settlement is only a valid contract if someone is giving up a legal right not to sue. If their claim was entirely without merit, the settlement offer can be rescinded.</p>
<h1>Installment contracts</h1>
<p>Substantial performance generally suffices under the ucc.</p>
<p>If a seller makes a nonconforming tender under one segment of an installment contract, the buyer can reject only if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that shipment to the buyer and cannot be cured. If the seller makes adequate assurances, the buyer must accept.</p>
<p>Modification: if a party benefits from a condition, they can generally orally waive that condition without new consideration. But in an installment contract, the waiver can be retracted via adequate notice unless it would be unjust due to a material change of position by the other party in reliance on the waiver. </p>
<h1>Objecting</h1>
<p>If both parties are merchants and a memo sufficient against one party is sent to the other party, who has reason to know its contents, and the receiving party does not object in writing within 10 days, then the contract is enforceable against the receiving party even though he has not signed it.</p>

                “A party alleging waiver or modification must establish a
mutual intention of the parties to waive or modify the original
contract. “[I]n the
same way a meeting of the minds is necessary to create a binding
contract, so also is a meeting of the minds necessary to modify
the contract after it has been made.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>

            <p>
                Simply put, one cannot
unilaterally modify a contract because by definition, a unilateral
modification lacks mutuality.
                
                    <a href=#num000>0</a>

            <p>
                This mutuality requirement is satisfied where a waiver or
modification is established through clear and convincing evidence
of a written agreement, oral agreement, or affirmative conduct
establishing mutual agreement to modify or waive the particular
original contract.

                Where one person has committed
a tort, breach of contract, or other legal wrong against another,
it is incumbent upon the latter to use such means as are reasonable
under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages. The
person wronged cannot recover for any item of damage which could
thus have been avoided.

            <p>
                At common law a plaintiff has a duty to mitigate his loss. It has long been recognized that the law
should encourage a potential plaintiff to take reasonable actions
to minimize the extent of damages arising from the wrongful breach
of a contract.
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>

            <p>
                “[T]he damages recoverable for breach of contract are those
that arise naturally from the breach or those that were in the
contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.” 
                
                    <a href=#num005>5</a>

            <p>
                Lost profits resulting from a breach of contract
are proper items of loss to be considered in determining
damages.
                
                    <a href=#num006>6</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lost profits are
recoverable if the defendants reasonably knew or should have known
that in the event of breach this plaintiff would lose profits.
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even where lost profits are difficult to calculate and are
speculative to some degree, they are still allowed as a loss item.
                
                    <a href=#num007>7</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Michigan case law indicates that doubts as to the
certainty of damages must be resolved against the wrongdoer.
                
                    <a href=#num006>6</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Courts apply an “objective
standard” of foreseeability, under which damages are recoverable
if “the defendants reasonably knew or should have known that in
the event of breach,” such damages would result.
                
                    <a href=#num003>3</a>

            <p>
                Punitive damages are
not available for breach of contract. Punitive damages in the absence of a statutory authorization are
not recoverable in Michigan.

            <p>
                The goal in contract law
is not to punish the breaching party, but to make the nonbreaching
party whole.
                
                    <a href=#num009>9</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Absent allegation and proof of tortious conduct
existing independent of the breach, exemplary damages may not be
awarded in common-law actions brought for breach of a commercial
contract.
                
                    <a href=#num010>10</a>

            <p>
                Neither law nor
equity will enforce a contract that is in violation of public
policy. Contracts in violation of public policy are void and unenforceable.

            <p>
                 Under
the doctrine of severability, “[a]n unlawful term in a contract is
severable from the whole unless that term is central to the
parties’ agreement. Hence, the failure of a distinct part of a
contract does not void valid, severable provisions.”
                
                    <a href=#num016>16</a>
                
                    <a href=#num017>17</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As a general rule, a contract is entire when, by its
terms, nature and purpose, it contemplates that each and
all of its parts are interdependent and common to one another and to the consideration, and is severable when,
in its nature and purpose, it is susceptible of division
and apportionment.

The singleness or apportionability of the consideration
appears to be the principal test. The question is
ordinarily determined by inquiring whether the contract
embraces one or more subject matters, whether the
obligation is due at the same time to the same person,
and whether the consideration is entire or apportioned.
                
                    <a href=#num018>18</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                “When the price is expressly
apportioned by the contract . . . to each item to be performed,
the contract will generally be held to be severable.
                
                    <a href=#num018>18</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In Michigan, a person who is a nonparty to a contract may
be entitled to sue to enforce the contract as a third-party
beneficiary.
                
                    <a href=#num019>19</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Any person for whose benefit a promise is made by way of
contract . . . has the same right to enforce said promise
that he would have had if the said promise had been made
directly to him as the promisee. (1) A promise shall be construed to have been made for
the benefit of a person whenever the promisor of said
promise had undertaken to give or to do or refrain from
doing something directly to or for said person.
                
                    <a href=#num020>20</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Not just any person who benefits
from a contract may enforce it. Rather, it states that a person is
a third-party beneficiary of a contract only when the promisor
undertakes an obligation ‘directly’ to or for the person.
                
                    <a href=#num021>21</a>
                
                    <a href=#num022>22</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Contracting parties must be “clearly
aware that the scope of their contractual undertakings encompasses
a third party, directly referred to in the contract, before the
third party is able to enforce the contract.”
                
                    <a href=#num021>21</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The standard for
determining whether a person is a third-party beneficiary is an
objective standard and must be determined from the language of the
contract only.
                
                    <a href=#num021>21</a>
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Only intended beneficiaries, not incidental
beneficiaries, may enforce a contract under 1405. A third person cannot
maintain an action on a simple contract merely because he or she
would receive a benefit from its performance or would be injured
by its breach.
