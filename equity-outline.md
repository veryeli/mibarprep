The object of a preliminary injuctions is to preserve the status quo. In order to obtain a preliminary injuction under MCR 3.310, the party seeking the injuction bears the burden of establishing it will suffer irreperable injury if the injunction is not issued. Because a preliminary injunction is a form of equitable releif, it should not be issued where the party seeking it has an adequate remedy at law. If injuctive relief is granted, the court rules provide that the matter must be tried on the merits within 6 months after the injuction is granted, unless the parties stipulate or good cause is shown.

Under Michigan law, injunctive releif is an extraordinary remedy that issues only when justice requires, there is no adequate remedy at law, and there exists a real and imminent danger of irreparable injury. A court must consider four factors: whether

1) the moving party made the required demonstration of irreperable harm

To establish irreperable injuty, a plaintiff must demonstate a non-compensable injury for which there is no legal measurement of damages or for which damages cannot be determined with a sufficient degree of certainty. The injury must be noth certian and great, and it must be actual rather than theoretical.

2) the harm to the applicant absent such an injunction outweighs the harm it would cause to the adverse party

3) the moving party showed it is likely to prevail on the merits (balance of equities)

4) there will be harm to the public interest if an injuction is issued.

A particularized showing of irreperable harm is an indispensable requirement.

The object of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo, so that upon the final hearing the rights of the parties may be determined without injury to either. The status quo which will be preserved by a preliminary injuction is the last actual, peaceable, noncontested status which preceded the pending controversy.
