        <h1>Domestic Relations</h1>
<h1>Change in circumstances</h1>
<p>Possible examples</p>
<p>Child getting into trouble in school</p>
<p>New medical therapy without consultation with one parent - this is properly cured by a show cause motion, not a change in custody. A change in custody is based on the best interest of the childrem, custody is not a reward and its loss not a punishment for bad acts by either parent.</p>
<p>Severity of a medican condition</p>
<p>Remarriage is NOT a change in circumstances but is a normal life event.</p>
<p>The court cannot change custody absent an evidentiary hearing, which should not be scheduled unless the moving party can provide an offer of proof sufficient that, if proved, it would comprise a significant change of circumstances or proper cause. At the evidentiary hearing, the first threshiold is whether an established custodial environment exists. This is important because where an established custodial environment exists is a necessary determination before the standard of proof can be determined. An established custodial environment is defined as follows: the custodial environment of a child is established if, over an appreciable time, the child naturally looks to the custodian in that environment for guidance, discipline, the necessities of life, and parental comfort. The age of the child, the physical environment, and the inclination of the custodian and the child as to permanency of the relationship shall also be considered.</p>
<p>If an established custodial environment exists, a change may be made only on clear and convincing evidence that it is in the child&rsquo;s best interest; if there is no established custodial environment or both parents have an established custodial environment, a preponderance of the evidence stanrd is sufficient to change custody.</p>
<h1>Children generally</h1>
<p>In matters regarding children (i.e. child support, parenting time, physical and legal custody) the divorce court has continuing jurisdiction to modify the judgment when there is a significant change in circumstances or proper cause which warrants that change. Until a propler cause or a significant change in circumstances is shown, a court has no authority to reconsider the best interests of child or the existence of an established custodial environment. The alleged proper cause/change in circumstance may not be a normal life change, but must be something generally not anticipated or predictable at the time of the consent judgment. </p>
<h1>Custody</h1>
<p>The court is bound by statute to consider a party&rsquo;s request for joint custody. </p>
<p>In considering whether to grant, they must consider the best interest factors, and whether the parents willbe able to cooperate and generally agree. </p>
<p>If there is an impasse, the court decides.</p>
<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>Under the UCCJEA which governs interstate child custody disputes, the home state of the children is the primary determiner of jurisdiction. Home state is defined as the state where the children lived with a perent or person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before a child custody proceeding commeces. Michigan has jurisdiction when it either is the home state or was within six months before the commencement of the proceedings when at least one parental person still lives in the state. </p>
<h2>Modification</h2>
<p>When faced with a motion to modify a previous custody award, the court must first consider whether the motion establoishes proper cause or a change in circumstances. This threshold inquiry must be made for the court to determine whether to hold an evidentiary hearing to revisit a prior custody award. </p>
<p>Next, the court considers whether an established custodial environment exists. If a modification would change the established environment, the movant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that a change is in the children&rsquo;s best interests.</p>
<p>A single-factor motion is relatively unlikely to succeed. </p>
<h2>Established custodial environment</h2>
<p>An established custodial environment is both a physical and psychological environment of a significant duration that fosters a relaitonship between a custodian and child and is marked by security, stability, and permanance. An establiched custodial environment can exist in more than one home and can be destroyed by repeated changes in physical custody and uncertianty created by an upcoming custody trial.</p>
<h1>Ending a Marriage</h1>
<p>One party paying the other&rsquo;s fees is permissible if one party is unable to pay and the other is able.  </p>
<h1>Financial Support</h1>
<p>The court has the ability to amend a previous agreement as to support. The moving party, however, must allege and prove a proper cause or change in circumstances.</p>
<p>A change in incomes may be such a proper cause.</p>
<p>Support numbers primarily set by Michigan Child Support Guidelines. Formula is the net incomes of the payer and recipients of the child support, together with the number of children eligible for support. </p>
<p>Availability of retroactive modification is limited. It is permissible only during a period that there was a pending petition for modification and notice of the petition was given to other party. </p>
<h3>Cohabitation</h3>
<p>Remarriage may end spousal support, but living with a partner does not. It <em>may</em> serve as the basis for determining an improved financial situation but it is not per se remarriage. </p>
<h3>Deviation from Michigan Child Support Guidelines</h3>
<p>Court must order support in line with guidelines unless they determine it would be unjust or innapropriate. They may adjust the amount to reflect such circumstances. If they do deviate from the formula, they must explain on the record </p>
<p>1) the amount that results from application of the formula, </p>
<p>2) how the amount it is ordering deviates from the formula</p>
<p>3) the value of any other support or property it is ordering in lieu of child support</p>
<p>4) reasons that applying the formula would be unjust or innapropriate.</p>
<p>If one party e.g. lives rent and utility free, that can be factored in as part of income. </p>
<h1>Extra Laws</h1>
<h3>Reference: best interests of the child</h3>
<p>(a) The love, affection, and other emotional ties existing between the parties involved and the child.</p>
<p>(b) The capacity and disposition of the parties involved to give the child love, affection, and guidance and to continue the education and raising of the child in his or her religion or creed, if any.</p>
<p>&copy; The capacity and disposition of the parties involved to provide the child with food, clothing, medical care or other remedial care recognized and permitted under the laws of this state in place of medical care, and other material needs.</p>
<p>(d) The length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment, and the desirability of maintaining continuity.</p>
<p>(e) The permanence, as a family unit, of the existing or proposed custodial home or homes.</p>
<p>(f) The moral fitness of the parties involved.</p>
<p>(g) The mental and physical health of the parties involved.</p>
<p>(h) The home, school, and community record of the child.</p>
<p>(i) The reasonable preference of the child, if the court considers the child to be of sufficient age to express preference.</p>
<p>(j) The willingness and ability of each of the parties to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between the child and the other parent or the child and the parents. A court may not consider negatively for the purposes of this factor any reasonable action taken by a parent to protect a child or that parent from sexual assault or domestic violence by the child&rsquo;s other parent.</p>
<p>(k) Domestic violence, regardless of whether the violence was directed against or witnessed by the child.</p>
<p>(l) Any other factor considered by the court to be relevant to a particular child custody dispute.</p>
<p>For the child&rsquo;s preference: the court is required, upon request of either parent, to interview the minor children. This interview is done privately by the court and the statements of the children are not revealed to either party or the attorneys. The judge has the discretion to attach whatever importance they decide to the statements of the child. The court must limit its discussions with the child to a determination of the childn&rsquo;t preference.</p>
<h2>Referees</h2>
<p>Referees are empowered under Michigan Law to hear many domestic matters. However, modifications of spousal support are specifically exempted from the referee&rsquo;s powers. A referee may hear all motions in a domestic relations referred by the court  except related to spouse support. </p>
