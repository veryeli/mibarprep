<h2> Injunctive Relief </h2>


<h3> (S2020) </h3>
“[i]njunctive relief is an extraordinary
remedy that issues only when justice requires, there is no adequate
remedy at law, and there exists a real and imminent danger of
irreparable injury.” Pontiac Fire Fighters Union Local v City of
Pontiac, 482 Mich 1, 8 (2008)



<h2> Test for preliminary injunction </h2>

<h3> (S2020) </h3>
In determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the
court must consider four factors: “whether (1) the moving party
made the required demonstration of irreparable harm, (2) the harm
to the applicant absent such an injunction outweighs the harm it
would cause to the adverse party, (3) the moving party showed that
it is likely to prevail on the merits, and (4) there will be harm
to the public interest if an injunction is issued.” Detroit Fire
Fighters Ass'n v City of Detroit, 482 Mich 18, 34 (2008)
