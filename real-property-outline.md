# Adverse Possession

* Open & Notorious

* Continuous

* Exclusive

* Adverse/Hostile

  While this varies state to state, in MI mistake with 'intent to hold the true line' does NOT count as hostile. However, after 15 years of everyone being chill about a fence, the doctrine of aquiescence works the same way.

  # Covenants

  Absent contrary language, every land sales contract contains an implied covenant of marketable title

  The seller is not required to deliver marketable title until the closing. In an installment land contract, marketable title is not required to be given until delivery occurs after all installment payments have been made. An undisclosed private encumbrance such as a mortgage renders title unmarketable. If a seller delivers an unmarketable title, a buyer may rescind the contact and recover payments, sue for breach of contract, or bring an action for specific performance with an abatement of the purchase price (e.g. price adjustment to compensate the buyer for the defect). 

  # Easements

  Under common law, an easement is an interest in real property that gives a person the right to use another's land for a specific purpose. An easement can be created by express grant or by operation of law. An express easement must be very clear in its intent.

  ### Recording and Notice

  The sale of a servient estate to a bona fide purchaser for value can make the easement unenforceable. But it has to be without notice - in the deed or properly recorded even if absent from the deed. 

  ### Easement by necessity

  In order for an easement by necessity to exist

  * the dominant and serviant estates have to have been once owned by the same person
  * the dominant estate must be virtually useless without the easement (necessity)
  * the necessity must have occurred when the easement was created.

  <h3> Easement by Prescription</h3>

  An easement by prescription is similar to aquiring property by adverse possession and requires the following elements: it must be adverse/hostle (no right or permission),must be continuous and uninterrupted for at least 15 years, and it must be open or visible and notorious.

  <h3>Overuse</h3>

  When an easement is silent, its use cannot exceed the scope of or overburden the easement or it amounts to excessive use. In that case, the remedy is to stop the excessive use, not to terminate the easement.

  A prescriptive easement is generally limited in scope by the manner in which it was acquired and the previous enjoyment. 

  But an express easement, this doesn't generally apply

  ### Terminating an easement

  An express easement can only be terminated via express written release, merger, severance, abandonment, prescription, or estoppel. 

  If someone tries to expand the dominant estate, that means the easement may be terminated. e.g. if you have an easement to cross plot of land A to access plot of land B, and then the owner of B aquires C which adjoins B and wants to cross A to access both B and C, that is an illegitimate use because it expands the dominant estate.

# Fixtures

Fructis naturales are wild crops that grow on the land. They are considered real property and pass with the land.

## Present Estates and Future Interests

OK so the whole thing is the fee simple absolute. Basiclaly this is my property indefinitely. But sometimes there's a way for someone else to take it.

## Present Estates

Life estate is when someone has the property for their life until they die, then it reverts to someone else. Life estate por autre vie is a life estate for someone else's life. I'd imagine like, if someone wants to leave their historic family home to a museaum, but his wife is living in it with their son, and he wants the son to own it until the wife dies then set out on his own two feet, he might give a life estate por autre vie or whatever to his son for the life of his wife.

<br>

OK if grantor Greg gives his property to Sophie with remainder to Renee, if Renee survives Sophie then

<ul> 
	<li> Sophie has a life estate that is possessory </li>
	<li> Renee has a future interest that will be possessory if she lives longer than Sophie. Also it will be a fee simple absolute. </li>
	<li> Greg has a furture interest that will be posessorry if she doesn't. Also that would then be a fee simple absolute. ANnd also a reversion. </li>
</ul>



## Future Interests

<h3> Retained by grantor</h3>

The three types of future interests are 

<ul>
	<li> reversion </li>
	<li> right of reverter </li>
	<li> right of reentry </li>
</ul>


Reversion happens when a finite estate, like a life estate, ends. So it goes back to whoever granted it.

Right of reverter happens when the grantor grants some property but it's subject to a condition that may or may not occur (not finite). When property is conveyed with a right of reverter, it is a fee simple determinable. If I give you land to make a communue, but you become a venture capitalist and don't make a communue, the land reverts to me.

Right of reentry is like a right of reverter except there's an option to re-take rather than it happening automatically. It requires a court order. Also, I think maybe, it's what automatically happens when what would otherwise be a reversion makes the property go to someone other than the grantor? Anyway this is called a fee simple defesable subject to a condition subsequent.

<h3> Given to grantee </h3>

OK so these three are 

<ul>
	<li> Vested Remainder</li>
	<li> Contingent remainder </li>
	<li> Executory interest</li>



A vested remainder occurs when it's definite that it will be passed on, and contingent means it depends on something happening (like Renee outliving Sophie above). That's a condition subsequent, because it applies after Sophie already controls the property. A _condition precedent_ would exist if I left my property to you but only if you graduated from clown school. The fancy name for what the person with control has when someone else has a condition subsequent interests is a vested remainder subject to divestment.

The different between a vested and non-vested remainder is among other things what happens when the person with control extringuishes their interest. If it's vested, it goes to the person with the future interest. Otherwisem it goes to an alternative grantee or else back to the grantor.

The difference between an executory interest and a vested remainder subject to divestment is that the person with the executory interest can just take once the condition becomes true. So it's about the thing happening rather than a different interest expiring. If the executory interest is in this category of rights held by grantees it's called shifting. If it's held by the grantor, it's a shifting executory interest.

### Fee simple subject to executory interest vs. fee simple subject to condition subsequent

If a condition would lead to the grantor re-taking, it's subject to a condition subsequent. If a third party takes, it's subject to an executory interest. 

### Precatory language vs conditional language.
Precatory language ("I'm conveying this to party X to do Y with it") creates a fee simple absolute. Conditional language ("I'm conveying this to party X so long as they do Y with it") creates a reversionary interest.

## Rule of convenience

When anyone in an open class becomes able to take possession, the class closes.


### Other random vocab

#### Ademption

A devise fails if it no longer belongs to the testator.

Anti-ademption statute - proceeds from the sale of the devise goes to devisee.

# Rights in Real Property

## Restrictive Covenants

Equitable servitudes are agreements about land that can be enforced through the court system. They must be 

* in writing
* intended to run with the land 
* touch and concern the land
* there must be notice

It can only be enforced by successors in interest to the original deed (like other people living in the same subdivision)

# Joint Tenancy and TIC

Either has the unilateral right to partition the property.

If there are three joint tenants, and one of them severs their interest somehow (including by selling it to another one) then B and C are joint tenants as to the 2/3 interest and TIC as to the 1/3 interest. If A sells to B, B has a 1/3 TIC interest and a 1/3 joint tenancy interest.

# Oil and gas rights

Strict liability for damage to all *preexisting structures*

# Real Estate Contracts

## Leases

Generally with subletting, the original tenant is primarily liable for the rent. But if the sublease is for the full remaining term, and is an assignation of the lease, then the subtenant is in privity with the landlord and the subtenant becomes liable.

### Estoppel by deed

If you convey property you don't own, then later you own it, you can't be like lol that wasn't my property to give, so you have nada. Instead, the person you gave it to before you owned it owns it now. 

### Equitable conversion

Once there's a contract to buy a house, the buyer bears the risk of loss even if the owner hasn't transferred the deed. But if something bad happens and the owner has insurance, the proceeds from the insurance gets applies against the purchase price.

# Mortgages/security devices


## Title theory vs lien theory

Lien theory is the dominant rule

In a title theory state, theoretically the morgagee can take possession at any point unless specifically prohibited by the terms of the mortgage.

## Wills

The devisee of real property is entitled to have any outstanding balance of a mortgage or other encumberance paid from the testator's estate, under the common law.

## Foreclosures



### Junior and Senior Mortgages

The priority/seniority of mortages is determined primarily by when they were recorded. Generally, forclosure on a senior mortgage eliminates all junior mortgages. However, if the junior mortgagee receives no notice, their mortgage is not eliminated.



### Equity of redemption

After a default on a mortgage obligation but before a foreclosure sale

### Statutory right of redemption

After a foreclosure sale, sometimes if a jurisdiction so provides the morgagor can reimburse the buyer and reclaim the property



## Defenses to Mortgages

If a mortgage is obtained through fraud/duress, the person who obtained it can use the defense and so can a subsequent *donee*. A subsequent *purchaser for value* cannot assert such defenses.

Generally, a grantor is subject to the same defenses as someone who enters into a mortgage.



## Priority

A purchase money mortage has priority before all other morgages. A purchase money mortgage is one “which takes effect immediately, as part of the ‘same transaction by which seisin was acquired by the mortgagor.”

A mortgage to pay off a land contract does not qualify as a PMSI.

Mortgagees are considered to have paid vlue and are protected by the recording acts, unless the mortgage is not given siimultaneously with a loan Unless the recording act governs the priority ot real property interests, the common law rule of first in time, first in right applies.

# Titles

## Deeds

### Requirements for a valid deed
* Grantor must demonstate intent to make a present transfer (e.g. via delivery)
* Grantee must accept (but often this is constructive in MBE problems)
* Writing
* Signed by grantor but generally not witnessed or notarized
* Grantor and grantee identified
* Words of transfer/granting clause
* Description of property 


### Forgeries
A deed that has a forged signature is void, but one where the signature was obtained by fraud is merely voidable and will become valid in the normal course of commerce/ to a bona fide purchaser without notice of the fraud


## Notice and deeds

In race notice jurisdictions, if X transfers to Y, Y fails to record, Y transfers to Z, Z records that doesn't necessarily constitute notice. Z's deed is a 'wild deed' because it is not within the chain of title. If X then transfers to Q and Q records, then Q will prevail. 

# Warranties

Generally, an implied covenent of marketable title is part of a contract to sell real property. 
So is a covenant of marketability - even with a quitclaim deed.

In the majority of jurisdictions the seller has a duty to disclose all known, material, physical defects that are not readily observable or known to the buyer. 


There are six general covenants of title

They are 
* (1/2) covenant for seisin/the right to convey

The grantor actually owns the estate

* (3) covenant against encumbrances

  There are no mortgages, liens, easements, or restrictions on use
* (4/5) covenant for quiet enjoyment/general warranty
No one will try to take it, no hostile claimants

* (6) covenant for further assurances.

Not really used but says grantor will try to protect grantees title.

## Special warranty deed

A special warranty deed includes the covenant against encimbrances but only as to the time the grantor had title.

## Merger

Obligation contained in the sale are merged into the deed.

# Water and stuff

A landowner may impound rainwater on their property and make reasonable use of it. Prior use applies to groundwater but not surface water.

# Gifts

If there is no monetary consideration given for a deed, someone may claim it must be set aside as an invalid inter-vivos gift. A person who attacks the validity of a gift has the burden of proving that no gift was made. For a gift to be valid, three elements must be satisfied

i) the donor must possess the intent to transfer the title gratuitously to the donee

ii) there must be actual or constructive delivery of the subject matter to the donee, unless it is already in the donee's possession and

3) the donee must accept the gift.

If the gift is beneficial, acceptance is presumed

Whether a legal document is a deed or a will turns on whether it conveys a present interest, in which case it is deemed a deed, or an interest on the death of the person who executed it, in which case it is a will. That determination depends on the intent of the person who executed the document.

# Anti-lapse statute

Traditional anti-lapse statutes prevent gifts from lapsing ony when those gifts were given to a family member.

# Shelly's Case

the Rule in Shelley's case merges remainders in a gantee's heirs into fee simple in the grantee

So imagine idk a shell closing around to X and X's heirs, and the shell is just a fee simple absolute in X

# The rule of Convenience

The rule of convenience dictates that a class should close as soon as any member of the class becomes entitled to take a gift
