<h1>Sales</h1>

<h2> Definitions </h2>
The law of sales is governed the version of Article 2 of the UCC adopted in Michigan. Article 2 of the UCC involves sales and generally applies to transactions in goods. It applies whether or not both or either parties are merchants.
<p> <b>Goods:</b> <span class='quiz'>all things (including specially manufactured goods)</span> which are moveable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid.</p>

<h2>Buyer's options</h2>
Generally, a buyer has three options with respect to tranactions in goods under the UCC. The buyer may <span class='quiz'> accept the goods, reject the goods, or revoke an acceptance of the goods.</span> 

<h2> Revocation</h2>
<p>
Revocation of acceptance of the goods is legally justified where there is a nonconformity with respect to the goods that substantially impairs its value to the buyer if he accepted iit without discovery of such nonconformity if his accpetance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances. Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller.

<h2> Firm Offer</h2>
Under the UCC's firm offer rule, an offer to buy or sell goods is irrevocable if the offeror is a merchant, there is an assurance that the offer is to remain open, and the assurance is contained in a signed writing from the offeror. 

<h2> Warranties</h2>
Express warranties can be created by the seller of gooos by any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain. 
<h3> Details</h3>
It is possible that a certificate of authenticity could provide a basis for a breach of warranty claim.

<h2> Damages</h2>
Remedies for recovery of damages are aailable to a buyer for a seller's breach of the contract. 

<h3>Resale</h3>
Unless the lost volume theory applies, reselling goods at the same price means there are no damages besides incidental costs.
<h3> Lost Volume</h3>
A lost volume seller must show that even if the buyer had not breached and had made the purchase, the seller would have been able to make a subsequent sale as well. If they can show this, they are entitled to lost profit on the marginal sale they did not make because of the breach.


<h2> Defenses</h2>
<h3>Lack of Financing</h3>
In the absence of a term in the contract making the contract contingent on obtaining financing, the person who needs financing is borne by the person who must obtain it.

<h2>Clauses and their enforcability</h2>
<h3>No oral modification clauses</h3>
Such clauses are valid and enforceable unless unconscionable, but an attempt at modification may count as a waiver. This is only reliable when the waiver results in reliance, though.
