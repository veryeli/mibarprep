        <h1>Partnership</h1>
<h1>Establishing a partnership</h1>
<p>A partnership exists where the parties agree and intend to enter into a relation in which the elements of partnership may be found. The elements of a partnership are generally considered to include a coluntary association of two or more people with legal capacity in order to carry on, via co-ownership, a business for profit. Co-ownership of the business requires more than merely joint ownershop of the property and is usually evidenced by joint control and the sharing of profits and losses. </p>
<p>The Michigan Unicform Partnership Act defines a partnershop as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a busness for profit.</p>
<p>It has also been held in Michigan that absent an express agreement, the test to be applied in determining whether a partnership existed is to examine the acts, declarations, and conduct of the parties in relation to the business and from the nature and scope of the business in which the acts are committed.</p>
<p>The question of intent to form a partnership is not solely determinative of whether a partnership actually existed. In ascertaining the existence of a partnership, the proper focus is on whether the parties intended to, and in fact did, carry on as co-owners of a business for profit and not whether the parties subjectively intended to form a partnership. The Court further stated that it is unimportant whether the parties would have labeled themselves as partners, as partners need not be aware of their status as partners in order to have legal partnership. The gist of the partnership relation is mutual agency and joint liability. The important indicia of a partnership include the filing of certificate of partnership, common authority in the administration and control of the business, a common interest in the capital employed and sharing in the profits and losses of the business.</p>
<p>The party alleging the partnership has the burden of proving that it exists.</p>
<p>A fiduciary relationship arises from the reposing of faith, confidence and trust and the reliance of one upon the judgment and advice of another. Partners stand in a fiduciary relationship to one another, and are charged with the duty of honesty, good faith, and full and frank disclosure of all relevant information. Every partner muist account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.</p>
<p>A partnership does exist when both parties contribute a portion of a down payment on a residence.</p>
<p>If there is an agreement to form a partnershop but no actual business carried on, then there is no partnership.</p>

                A partnership is an association of two or more persons to be the co-owners of a business for profit.

            <p>
                In determining whether a partnership exists, the primary question is "whether the parties intentionally acted as co-owners of a business for
    profit, and not on whether they consciously intended to create the legal relationship of 'partner-ship.'" 
                
                    <a href=#num001>1</a>

            <p>
                The burden of proof to show a partnership is on the party alleging the partnership.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                Generally, the party alleging the partnership is required to prove that a partnership exists by a preponderance of the evidence.

            <p>
                Where the alleged partners are <b>relatives</b> the party alleging the partnership is required to prove the existence of the partnership by clear and convincing evidence.

                MCL 449.7 lays out specific rules for determining the existence of partnership.

                The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business
                
                    <a href=#num007>7</a>

            <p>
                MCL 449.7(4) lays out several exceptions to the "prima facie evidence" rule.
        It states that no inference of partnership is drawn if the profits were received
        if in payment "[a]s a debt by installments or otherwise,".
